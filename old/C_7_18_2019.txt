NotJuses: Boeing (BA) to Take $4.9 Billion Charge on 737 Max Fallout
   NotJuses:  **COPY FOR THE POOR:**&#x200B;&#x200B;[Boeing Co.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/BA:US) plans to record a $4.9 billion accounting charge related to its beleaguered 737 Max jetliner when the company reports quarterly earnings next week.The after-tax charge, equivalent to $8.74 a share, covers potential concessions and considerations for airline customers who have been forced to cancel thousands of flights and line up replacement aircraft since the Max was grounded in March, the company said in a [statement](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/PUUUA33MMTC1) Thursday. The costs will clip $5.6 billion from revenue and pretax earnings in the quarter.The writedown underscores the financial cost to Boeing after two deadly crashes in a five-month span engulfed the U.S. planemaker in one of the biggest crises in its century-long history. New flight-computer software on the Max, Boeing‚Äôs best-selling jet, has been linked to the disasters in Indonesia and Ethiopia, and company engineers are still working on an update.‚ÄúThis is a defining moment for Boeing,‚Äù Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said in the statement. ‚ÄúNothing is more important to us than the safety of the flight crews and passengers who fly on our airplanes. The Max grounding presents significant headwinds and the financial impact recognized this quarter reflects the current challenges and helps to address future financial risks.‚ÄùBoeing climbed 1.3% to $365.66 after the close of regular trading in New York. Since the March 10 crash of an Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max 8 jet, Boeing has fallen 15%, the biggest decline on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.### Return to ServiceInvestors will be parsing the company‚Äôs results, slated for July 24, for additional details of the financial blow that Boeing is absorbing as it churns out the Max while waiting for regulators to clear the single-aisle workhorse to resume commercial flights. The company said it‚Äôs assuming that approval of the plane‚Äôs ‚Äúreturn to service in the U.S. and other jurisdictions begins early in the fourth quarter‚Äù of this year.Boeing‚Äôs first-quarter profit margins were dented by $1 billion in estimated costs after it cut factory output of the narrow-body jets following the global grounding. That estimated expense has grown by another $1.7 billion, primarily due to a ‚Äúlonger than expected reduction in the production rate,‚Äù the company said.The higher costs will reduce the margin for the 737 program, Boeing‚Äôs largest source of profit and revenue, in the second quarter and future quarters.A total of 346 people died in the crashes.
lax_street: Why did Boeing (BA) go up 2% after announcing it‚Äôs taking a $5 bn hit?
   allianc4: Known > Unknown
   themcstarsons: Market had priced in a bigger hit
   WBigly-Reddit: Federal Budget breakthrough today
   dont-lose: My guess it‚Äôs the same reason $FB popped when it was fined 5 billion. To a company like Boeing, the market believes 5 billion shouldn‚Äôt have that big of an impact.
   ladidadi82: The same reason any other stock goes up or down. It's random, fairy dust, fugazi.
   waughkytoky: not as big or bad a hit as expected maybe. The stock is down ~20% from highs. $5B charge is less than 3% of mktcap. If this continues for another year that's still only ~12%
   seaybl: God my Call is going to the moon! Probably because company knows what to expect and can plan and move on. Jesus lord my chinos just went to high waters!
   PayMe4TradeIdeas: We are in a opposite parallel world, same reason when mu beats earning by 25% and raises guidance by 30% and announce to buy back 40% of the float it goes down 20% when boeing takes a $9 earning per share charges before the lawsuit and future growth loss of customer confidence it has to go up!
   angeleyes1991: Because it was seen as oh just 5 b ok we can take that.

   SeanyboyX: Worked in tech (mobile apps) for 2 years. Got into the stock market spring 2016 ( no money put in the market I just followed it) , All in'ed oil in Sep 2016  @ mid 40s made like 30% in my 1st month. Got laid off from work and continued to study/play the stock market and the finance world. (8hrs a day for the first 2 years)Since I started im:Time weighted return 99.28% vs S&P 500 46.42%Personal rate of return 85% Sep 2016 - presentThis January I started going to school for finance. I took/taking courses that can aid me in the stock market because i'm not sure if ill follow through with the diploma/certificate. I completed 2 accounting classes/macroeconomics and i'm taking a general finance course.Started doing more short term trades and built confidence.Since Feb I've locked in 24 trades and I've lost money on only 3.1 was oil , 1 was a sell to buy something that was climbing faster( 96$ loss to make 514$), 3rd loss I got spooked by the nasdaq and re bought after it went down. I only trade tech because I have a tech background and I've also traded oil a few times. ( I trade what I know) Every stock I trade I need to be comfortable throwing large amounts of money into in case a correction or crash happens and I need to go long. ( Except oil )I'm trading because the volatility has been too good and I identify patterns / trends easy.
   hey-look-over-there: 3 degrees, two undergrad, one Masters in Math and ECE.  &#x200B;Its all speculation! I buy options whenever I notice trends but usually get it wrong. Still fun.  &#x200B;As far as research and planning... yeah no. It just doesn't work that way. None of the shit I learned in attending finance classes actually work as well as the textbook makes them out to be. The books were cool in being formal and teaching basics but fuck if they can actually predict shit.

originalmuggins: Can someone lay out the bull case for NFLX?
   Stickey794: H U L U  B O I S
   OrangesAreOrangeHa: They stop letting everyone share accounts and their subscriber base grows by a billion users.
   dephira: More of a bear but imo the clear bull case for Netflix is that they continue to take a huge share of the streaming market that is experiencing huge secular tailwinds worldwide. America was the first mover in this market and is also the most saturated, hence the drop. But even in this disappointing quarter, revenue grew 25% yoy. They‚Äôre adding international subscribers at a fast clip. Netflix is synonymous with streaming worldwide. I think two main trends are happening, the confluence of which may turn you into a bull:1) streaming is taking market share from tv worldwide2) Netflix is the biggest player by far in streaming, worldwide. All those new streaming services? NBC, Warner, whatever? They are never gonna take off at the same rate that Netflix has. Never ever. They‚Äôre way too late to the game. Everyone is whining about The Office leaving Netflix - are 150 million users going to subscribe to NBC to watch The Office? I don‚Äôt see it. NFLX is way ahead and has a sticky subscriber base. That gives them tons of steady income to keep developing content. All competitors have to offer *amazing* content to get people to subscribe. Netflix has to churn out enough *meh* content for Becky and Jason to think ‚Äúeh, it‚Äôs good enough for me not to go through the process of unsubscribing‚Äù. They‚Äôre undoubtedly in a very, very comfortable position to win the steaming wars. That said it‚Äôs still overpriced and I think it‚Äôll drop more long term.
   FireSail: I don't think it's fair to say other countries won't adopt streaming like the US does. They might just need to catch up. I'd argue also that Netflix produces a lot of shows in different languages for different cultures, using actors from those countries. I think that's a seed that has yet to sprout. Biggest thing is -- quality of Netflix content is really good. House of Cards, Orange is the New Black, Narcos, Stranger Things, Ozark, Master of None, Bojack Horseman, Big Mouth, Chef's Table, Making a Murderer, Black Mirror's continuation... these are all hugely popular shows. That's not to mention other quality stuff like Lilyhammer, Santa Clarita Diet, Roman Empire, or the documentaries that they have.All this stuff has come out in the last 6 years, more or less. What other network has had that amount of success in the same amount of time? HBO, maybe? Disney's still milking intellectual property that's 30 years old. Star Wars and Marvel will get tired out too.Right now whatever gap there is in Netflix, I fill with Amazon Prime Video. There I'll buy individual shows like The Wire, or movies like Samsara. Between the two, I can't see what reason I'd have then to buy into Disney, other than if I have kids and want to get Disney stuff then.
   fco1017: Bull case is NFLX buys HBO or T buys NFLX.
   ringrawer: It's not difficult for companies to launch a streaming service anymore so their catalog will continued to be carved up, that is unless they lobby to reform copy right so that everything goes into public domain after 20 years like patents.That was the original intent until lobbyist got involved. https://i.ibb.co/Qjv0DdT/695997ae63ebea0e4461777d4fc61611c9f85d6fb6fb43ac2573e1bd22b1d1b9.png If Netflix changed copyright like that they could use the money they would have spent on licensing to produce content with IPs like the following.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redwallhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prelude_to_AxanarI want a reform so fans can produce content like this.
   Buy_High_Sell_Sober: Bull case (I‚Äôm grasping at straws butt fuck it). In the next 2 years or so $NTFLX launches a ‚Äúthe office‚Äù killer, a ‚Äúgame of thrones‚Äù killer, and a ‚Äúhandmaids tale‚Äù killer.   Basically, AMAZING content that gets new subscribers. They‚Äôre throwing spaghetti at the wall, and right now it‚Äôs not sticking (I‚Äôm sorry but when stranger things is your big name brand show üòÇ lolololol) but if they ever get the formulae correct üìà
   rowdeecs: Simply put, the lack of good shit on Netflix and focus on the originals. People bought Netflix to watch their favourite tv shows whenever they wanted without having to buy each series individually. The stuff people wanted to watch gets pulled off due to either Netflix not having a contract, or the producing company starting up their own streaming service. People realise ‚ÄúOh there‚Äôs now nothing good on Netflix (except daredevil).‚Äù And then they don‚Äôt renew their subscription.
   x2manypips: short term: retrace to 340. Long term: i have no clue
   jokemon: NFLX actually finds some quality writers and produces a show the likes of breaking bad / better call saul etc... it will kill it with subscribers.Right now they keep producing movies and shows that might sound cool but dont quite exactly fit that "I NEED TO WATCH THIS" mood.Take umbrella academy.  This show has good potential but they made the characters extremely cheesy and cliche.They should also start releasing 1 episode per week on their shows to keep people from finishing the content in 1 day.
   GoldenKaze: Netflix shows like The Office are also going away and being replaced with Obama Documentaries. Can't go tits
   Petroselinum_: Yeah. Bulls take shits (i.e. bullshit). $NFLX just took a shit as well. $NFLX = ~~bullshit~~ *bull...ish*. Long $NFLX.
   Deecoli: APPL buyout
   TenaciousStu: Bullcase: Everyone freaking out about new streaming services. Remember [Seeso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seeso)? &#x200B;Seeso was cheap, had the NBC comedy library, standup specials and other originals. Did I mention cheap? Oh, yeah. And it failed, miserably. &#x200B;Disney will give Netflix a run, because people will want that content. But the HBO Max thing? I already go HBO. Why do I want that other garbage at a higher price? Oh yeah, I don't. Cuz if I did, I'd already be paying for it. &#x200B;Seriously, people are freaking because Netflix is losing The Office and Friends? LOL&#x200B;Anyway, that's my bull case. &#x200B;...&#x200B;...&#x200B;...&#x200B;More like bull SHIT case, amiritebois?!

   NGski86: Wait for oil to confirm support at 55, if it fails you could short it to 50 into next week. Im waiting for the long here on a bounce at 55. I dont think its going much lower. This week was. Bloodbath and "something" is gona happen that props it back up.

antsy123: Come suck my pp u/Dangelo_mixtape for calling my nflx play retarded and sloppy
   BeastftMiddleEast: CUTTHROAT SHIT. OP said FUCK YOU u/Dangelo_mixtape and went and made 10 racks to flex on us all. This is the shit we all like to see, grats OP
   EddHaste: This is the WSB spirit that I come here everyday to see
   ToryRex: **Summary:**Yesterday, before market close, OP posted his $8,500 NFLX earnings position, which /u/Dangelo_mixtape called ["retarded" and "sloppy", claiming that OP will "get fucked royally if they post a bad earnings"](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cegcg9/long_disney/eu2kxkd/). OP responded and provided his full position in a screenshot within the same post, indicating that he shifted his position down to protect against the possibility of NFLX falling on earnings.NFLX earnings came in well below expectations, and the stock tanked over 10% after hours.Despite the drop, the adjustment yesterday resulted in the above gain for OP. After seeing this post, /u/Dangelo_mixtape commented ["people get lucky all the time" and claimed OP "got bailed out because Netflix posted a terrible sub number", even saying it was OP's "first time to the rodeo to brag so aggressively about a 4 digit win"](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cetxd8/come_suck_my_pp_udangelo_mixtape_for_calling_my/eu4zbj9/).As more comments call out his poor responses, /u/Dangelo_mixtape then [proceeds to spam "Cuck" at random people commenting on the post](https://imgur.com/InnZfVM)./u/Dangelo_mixtape then [called on the mods to ban OP's "faggot ass for this gay shit"](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cetxd8/come_suck_my_pp_udangelo_mixtape_for_calling_my/eu507v8/). To which [the moderators responded](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cetxd8/come_suck_my_pp_udangelo_mixtape_for_calling_my/eu56lrm/) by banning /u/Dangelo_mixtape instead.OP then receives a chat message from /u/Dangelo_mixtape claiming he was [a "depressed person in life, and this shit added to the anxiety today", and that he claimed OP "petitioned an entire gang of people to target him", ruining his experience in WSB](https://imgur.com/EVosZ0b). While he did admit that he was an asshole on the sub, his account then commits seppuku and is deleted.**EDIT:**In case you feel bad for /u/Dangelo_mixtape, just a reminder that he did post comments within the past 24 hours on the sub such as ["Stop quoting my post like a little bitch seeking reddit karma trying to salvage your weak as fuck arguments littered with shitty reasoning"](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cehpdq/_/eu34f8d) and ["This is what poverty looks like / Poor guy and his family can‚Äôt even afford a Netflix subscription"](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cehpdq/_/eu2r9ar)

BuffaloNicholas1: TSLA earnings next week
   snoooooooooo: Tesla put out big truck to drive selfTruck go vroom vroom Buy call
   Xillllix: It‚Äôs going to go up. ‚ÄúRecord quarter *on every level* ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you watch the LOTR gifs?Do it for Frodo.
   GildedCodpiece: My pee pee twitches in anticipation.
   oregon_forever: They will announce a loss but guide for a profit for Q3 & Q4, so the stock will likely go up.
   ztw2002: gonna write way OTM calls
   Networking4Eyes: This will be the tell if positive delivery numbers translate into increased revenue. From a technical standpoint the monthly chart looks great for continued gains although there is some resistance coming up at $273 (weekly 200 MA). Siphoning off volatility premium is the best play here. $TSLA has been my biggest money maker in this regard.
   mikesetera: I refuse to bet against based Elon but I do hope it drops so I can buy it cheaper.
   4thlineorangepeeler: Idk they slashed prices this quarter. Bullish on TSLA long term but idk what the ER will spell for shareholders.
   WaffleAndButter: closing out all my calls during hours on the 24th then BTFD the next day
   SummerSnow8: need Elon to show the shorts who's boss during the earnings call
   Hikamiro: ‚ÄúElon said they were likely to post profit in q2‚Äù. What?
   jgalt5042: Cautious, but long.
   kemar7856: Back to $300 pls
   Roxorek: TSLA went up 45% in less than 2 months u have to be suicidal to be buying calls. Worst risk to reward ever.
   OrangesAreOrangeHa: I have calls that I expect to be selling at close to even right before earnings and I haven't decided how big of a bitch I'm going to be about it yet.  If I can turn any sort of profit before earnings, I'll probably sell but that's because I was stupid when I bought the calls in the first place.
   omega4relay: it will only tank once it makes sense to go long
IAmABlubFish: $msft earnings FD -- bought too early
   EkoLane: And here I am worried about my sep 145 calls..
   IAmABlubFish: Just a very small bet.  I normally don't buy FDs or any short dated calls, but in this case my Dad texted me and mentioned he was buying these.  Why not lose money together, as father and son?!&#x200B;I plan to just ride or die on these, wish me luck.

   Red8Rain: ooo FFS.  I have a meeting from 2-3p today!!!
   BugsSuck: Bad earnings and guidance = large profit taking sell off, definite recover by 12/20 with more cautious investorsGood earnings and guidance = small profit taking sell off, big dicked folks buy dip, stock starts its rally a few weeks post earnings.Great earnings = Trade sideways, rally starts closer to fall stillI don't think you can win with calls on MSFT for 7/19, 7/26 or 8/2 but for your sake I hope I'm proven wrong
   naptimerider: It‚Äôs time to trade at $133. Lol
   Mologna13: Any reason why you picked the 140 and not the 137?
   k-selectride: I'm 1428 shares deep. Almost all my gains from the last 2 weeks have been wiped out, lmao. I'm just gonna sell covered calls until the end of time.
   Akkis: Debating selling my 137 7/26 calls at a 25% loss right now. Get out before earnings.
   Argent_: if you didn't buy MSFT puts you're dumb. I bet they beat the shit out of everything, lowered guidance, china, blah blah, tanks, goes back to where it is on monday, everyone loses.
BigGuy4UftCIA: Corn futures undervalued?
   Networking4Eyes: \*Looks out the window\* Corn's doing fine. It took forever to get it in the ground but it's happy now.
   Moravid: Difficult buying at this level&#x200B; [https://www.tradingview.com/chart/CORNUSD/ZY8Hn1Vj-Corn-The-High-May-Be-In/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/CORNUSD/ZY8Hn1Vj-Corn-The-High-May-Be-In/)
   waughkytoky: still? where you been the last couple months?Why do you think ending stocks are tight? I would say there is some waiting on more data, not just weather-related and yield stuff, but internally people talking about things like China negotiations/government programs subsidies etc.. (2019 payments and beyond) and some technical price action as futures roll.
2_uber: [UPDATE] My Risk-Free, Can't Go Tits Up NFLX Arbitrage Play
   SignedUpWhilePooping: So your risked $1953 to make $873? Might not be a huge number but damn near 45% return on any option play is good. The sub loves crazy risks with insane loss or gain but we also appreciate more conservative stuff. We're just quieter about it.
   SteviaJ0bs: The right mindset to read WSB is " Fuck all yall". Cheers.
   csaw_88: Ok I might be retarted but this wasn‚Äôt actually risk free right?
   RBC_SUCKS_BALLS: son of a bitch the bastard did it
   jesseross14: No one thought this was a bad play. I just recall mentioning that light move or no move with IV drop could leave you in a loss. This clearly how the stock reacted to the earnings call. Good job. Nice gains.
   triptamimico: Oh man. Remember me? I said i would do a calendar spread. Expected to drop 20$ not 40$ Nutted a 50%loss on a 300$ position
   manojk92: I was pretty close to the 1k in profits estimate. IMO you should have waited until later in the day to close it. The short put would have lost ~10-15% of its extrinsic value. As long as netflix didn't go over $330 you stood to make more money by waiting.
   DBick289: What was the NFLX stock price roughly when you bought these?
   Negido: Yeah good call.  Turns out I was wrong.  Grats on your big dick victory.
   hungarianhc: So much work for so little money.
   BigMacRedneck: I would do a chimney top and double on the first week TV ratings are available.
   satireplusplus: It only worked because NFLX moved more than the estimated post-ER move (more than one standard derivation). And you were leaning bearish with the wider put strikes (10 vs 5 on the call side). I still think it wasn't a great option combo, as your chance of profit vs. risk taken wasn't that great. A simple straddle would have produced better results.
   fco1017: Good job.  &#x200B;I got raped.
   hellojoe93: Solid
   Alienova: i don't understand why you guys try making these bets on the future.  Future is hard to predict.  Definitely easier to make money knowing the past.
   Networking4Eyes: [Nice.](http://giphygifs.s3.amazonaws.com/media/S3Ot3hZ5bcy8o/giphy.gif)
   BlindDollar: Congrats. What sucks with calendar spreads is if the price moves too far in your favor your long position loses its time value.
xiyatu_shuaige: Long $GEO: Buy the Dip, Slavery is Legal
   silverpaw1786: >Time for a quick civics lesson WSB: the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution reads, in part: "No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."  This is generally understood to ban slaveryYou fucking autistic moron.  The Fourteenth Amendment was ratified two and a half years **after** the Thirteenth Amendment banned slavery.Not only is the Fourteenth Amendment not the amendment that bans slavery, but if we look at the correct amendment, it makes your point far more clearly:>Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.-Thirteenth Amendment(The rest of your argument stands.  Long GEO unless you think a Democrat wins in 2020.)

atlantic68: Short AMRN on the offering
   Damiencbw: I agree with you in the short term, mainly because this stock always gets hammered, good news or bad. There might be a nice opportunity here, but it could just as easily be a trap.  However, the JELIS study results from Japan seem to disagree with your assessment that a high fish diet is all you need.  You should also look into REDUCE-IT. I'm not a doctor bit it looks pretty spectacular to me!AMRN will soon have 600M+ cash on hand for a sales blitz, and an extremely high chance of expanded label approval by September.  Further, 40% of America is considered obese, and 3 out of 4 are overweight.  Do you know any Americans that eat a regular, heart healthy diet?  We are all about that magic pill so they are gonna sell the shit out of this, "Glorified fish oil" or not. Gotta spend money to make money!

Damiencbw: When you brag about your AMRN bags on wsb and they announce a 400M secondary a week later
   Damiencbw: Credit to Mitch Griffith's "Consumption" that I saw on reddit a couple days ago.  What a great picture.Also:I'M NOT FUCKING SELLING BOIS!  However, due to the 6%ish dilution, I'm gonna have to adjust my "buyout, bankrupt, or 80 pt" to "buyout, bankrupt, or 75.50 pt."  I'll continue to add when I can regardless of share price (as I've been doing since September) and will keep you fellow degenerates posted no matter which way it goes.  Have a great day and grats to any shorts that got a sweet payday off this. AMRN should now have 600-620M cash, so if the label expansion goes through by September it will be interesting to see how much higher they can ramp up sales.

My main problem was that I was winning every trade for way too long, I had no real idea of what my actual risk tolerance was. I started playing with way too much money and couldn‚Äôt handle the intra-week losses so I ended up with very weak hands, then I started trading on tilt and chasing stupid trades.I‚Äôm not gonna kill myself, I just needed to tell someone because I‚Äôm too embarrassed to tell my gf or parents.If you haven‚Äôt felt 40-50% losses yet, do not increase your net, because you don‚Äôt know how weak your hands are until you start watching your life savings evaporate.My last 6k is in a 7/26 spy 300c, currently down 400.

If they are so bullish on Chipotle and raising the price target to $700 why maintain an equal weight rating, why not also give the stock an overweight rating like other stocks they are bullish on? I wonder if the analysts were asked to not rate the stock "overweight" to avoid the potential jokes and PR hassle from associating the fast food restaurant with the word "overweight" in any capacity or context.

In a future where the dollar is no longer a reserve currency, US debt isn't AAA, or its yield doesn't look decent it could be dangerous, but not right now.

   Fagatoli: Lock in the principal or a large % of the profits and keep an eye on the remainder. If profitability dips too much, grab the rest of the tendies otherwise let it ride.
   Daynjazone: I'd sell. I think we will see a little more red, but the theta decay and loss in IV will hurt your premium more than a couple much smaller red days. Plus, who knows, a BTD crew could jump in and wreck your gains. Go lock it in.

   deposit_reg: Ray Dalio will turn 70 in two weeks. Have you ever met anyone above 60 not excited about gold? Pass.
   Avena_Sativa_2: trading ideas for making income off of gold:
   waughkytoky: nice share. always fun reading Dalio. I'll add his name to this list of old dudes from the previous generation of fund managers trying to scaremonger and push people to buy gold again (often the gold they bought too much of and now want to sell).

   babybarbeque: All in JNUG
   Heightx: Never trust a man that:1) Appeared on CNBC2) Last name rhymes with polio.
   Power80770M: I always find it bemusing when I read debates on QE on Reddit, and some know-it-all with a master's degree in economics (probably from MIT) appears and starts explaining to us why we're so stupid, and why QE is *not* moneyprinting.Dalio literally refers to it as moneyprinting. One of the best hedge fund investors managing hundreds of billions of dollars refers to it thusly. What now, MIT econ douche?
   CanisTokay: *William Jennings Bryan triggered
   -TheseHandsDontHaze-: Don‚Äôt forget about silver
   Turkeysub32: He‚Äôs saying two things in support of gold:1) Gold does well in inflationary environments, and as such should be part of your portfolio because it is diversifying (stocks and bonds typically underperform during periods of higher than expected inflation) 2) The next recession is a) coming soon and b) likely to be an inflationary one (for the reasons laid out in his post).
   realister: new Peter Schiff? Gold has under performed everything its a waste.
   Northwulf: I read his books. My only conclusion is that the people who recommended them have not read them. Therefore I do not trust anything in the realm om Dalio and recommendations. Also, as no one gets rich from reading about how rich people got rich and trying to replicate it. We can only conclude that they were incredibly lucky. And the explanations posed in books are just delusional attempts of hiding that fact.btw, gold anyone?
   genericdeveloper: I want to believe.
   dvfw: When the depression hits, the debt bubble will burst, and gold will go to the moon.

   onewiththepeople: Any use buying Gold-ETF's or are there other options?
   ThatOneRedditBro: I've been seeing gold infomercials for the last 4 years on t.v.   Gold is suddenly making a move  Low rates means higher inflation.   Earnings are coming in slower.   Asia is reporting lowest GDP numbers in decades  Do the math and connect the dots fellas, recession is here.  Good is a strong winner for the next few years
   radioactiviti: https://youtu.be/PHe0bXAIuk0Watch this video by Ray. It‚Äôs very informative
   Tc0008: We have so much debts out there and there is no way in the world the countries can buy enough gold to use that ever to support its currency.  At least I don‚Äôt see it happening in any foreseeable future.  Maybe the next few generations.

   hearthebell: I actually had drawn good dick pics when I was in elemetary and middle school too, so this was somehow relatable. There was a girl who was also my crush, and when she found out I was the one who's drawn the dick pic that's passing among the WHOLE classroom, she said to me:"Can't believe you became so bad already!"

   pkkiller69: Read the 10k you autistic fuck**2018 FY Income Statement**Rev $16bnCOGS $10bnNet Income $1bn**2018 FY Cash Flow Statement (CFO section)**"Additions to streaming content assets" negative $13bnCorps have been complaining since the dawn of US GAAP that R&D gets expensed and not capitalized, while CapEx does. Reed Hastings is lucky that none of you read the financials and realize that Netflix is some Chinese scam shit. Raw quote from note 1>"The Company acquires, licenses and produces content, including original programming, in order to offer members unlimited viewing of TV series and films. The content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to streaming assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within "Net cash used in operating activities" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.For licenses, the Company capitalizes the fee per title and records a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. The portion available for streaming within one year is recognized as ‚ÄúCurrent content assets, net‚Äù and the remaining portion as ‚ÄúNon-current content assets, net‚Äù on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.For productions, the Company capitalizes costs associated with the production, including development costs, direct costs and production overhead. These amounts are included in "Non-current content assets, net" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs."**TL;DR**Additions to streaming content is an increase in net working capital, therefore it bypasses the I/S, but needs to be deducted from NI to get to FCF, and it also shows up as a asset on the B/S that Netflix incurs too little depreciation periodically on (netflix, i don't think, has ever taken an impairment charge against its content library -which is so naughty)
   OhioBaseball: You aren‚Äôt misunderstanding anything. Cash flow is what matters and theirs is really bad. Considering their reliance on the high yield market to fund their spend, cash flow matters. Bond investors don‚Äôt get paid back with EPS. Netflix EPS is really not that important in my opinion b/c the accounting is atypical and I believe misleading to many investors that think this thing is profitable. From accounting earnings it is profitable, but cash earnings are poor and that is what matters.This has been the story with Netflix for a long time though, and it‚Äôs not why the stock is down today. It‚Äôs only the subscribers stuff today.The problem with Netflix is it needs its Daddy high yield market to grow, whereas Disney, HBO and Amazon can fund themselves and subsidize their streaming services internally for many years to gain share with its other cash flow positive businesses. High yield dries up and Netflix is in real trouble but we aren‚Äôt there now. At some point people will care about Netflix‚Äô cash flow problems but the time isn‚Äôt now.
   Grrr_Mondays: [Netflix in a nutshell](https://youtu.be/BzAdXyPYKQo)
   vimspate: When fb fucked last time from $200 to $150 in one day everyone was saying because of privacy issues people start deleting fb.. See fb is back to 200.. Now we are saying people r not using Netflix because of shit content and DIS. But all will be well in 6 months. Problem is we have to wait another 6 months.
   charvo: I'm assuming Netflix is buying a ton of licenses to media that they will amortize over the length of the contract.  Maybe it's front loaded in terms of what they have to pay.
   tempaccount920123: amschind>How can they have positive earnings but incredibly negative FCF? It looks like their spending on content is completely independent of "cost of goods sold", essentially as ian nvestment rather than an ongoing expense.Braindead investors and an SEC that don't give a shit.>My understanding of stocks is heavily rooted in automobiles and semiconductors.Dear god, it's been like 3 months since I saw a post from someone with that background.>There, R&D is a huge expense, for semiconductors moreso than autos. Intel, AMD, Qualcomm and Nvidia all subtract their absolutely massive R&D expenditures from their equally massive gross margins (AMD's margins were unsustainable bad at less than 40%, Intel is doing well at better than 50%), but their earnings are nowhere near that high because the EPS already has the R&D subtracted out.Yeah, I don't get it either - Intel could *easily* change their accounting to Netflix's style, but I'm guessing that the SEC/pension/Vanguard/Blackrock funds don't put up with that shit.>Semiconductor companies cannot survive on their back catalogs, and massive R&D spending is an ongoing necessity. While it is not a cost of sales line item, it comes out of revenue before earnings. Similarly, NFLX cannot survive on its back catalog (i.e. binge watching Stranger Things 1-3...in 2027) at least not at anything like its present valuation. That is even more true with competitors pulling third party content back onto their own, new streaming platforms while continuing to produce new, competitive content.There is a counterargument to this: Disney, but that's obviously the exception, not the rule. Disney's back catalog is *easily* worth a few billion, given the ridiculous copyright protection, marketing and merchandising setup they've got.>From that angle, I would argue that while there may be some justification for how NFLX calculates EPS, the way that they do it excludes a massive line item that they cannot reduce without tanking revenue. Therefore, by their accounting standards, EPS is virtually meaningless while FCF is the only metric that matters. NFLX seems less like a profitable company with international subscriber growth issues and domestic market saturation and more like a company that is literally hemorrhaging capital in a model that will never generate actual profits.Oh, you've heard of the Uber/Enron business model? Uber's burned through $16 billion, likely burning through the $24 billion from the IPO, and their profit margin is -140% - aka you spend $10 on a ride, it costs Uber $24.The Dollop on Uber (shit is funny): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QpKHhFwf1s
   cornbreadthug10: Best quote from my favorite finance professor - "Companies still show positive earnings the day before they file for bankruptcy. If you want to see if a company is profitable, look to the cash flow statement and FCF."Netflix is and pretty much always has been hemorrhaging cash, even more so now that they are trying to create such massive loads of content.  There is a reason media companies drop a new show once a week and not all at once. It keeps their customers engaged for months following a show. Everybody wants to say that Stranger things is what will save Netflix. How will it when I can pay for one month of subscription and delete it immediately after bingeing the show? (And this applies to any Netflix original show). I could just wait until the majority of the shows I like by Netflix have dropped, and then binge for a month and cancel. Netflix is doomed. They should have stopped with the content creation and just paid fees to NBC, FOX, ABC, etc to keep shows on Netflix platform. Now it's too late.

   nameulcon:  This much thought means your in the wrong sub
   shamrock_muffin: Downies or uppies... which is it?
   SP3NTt: So I believe the cost of content is included in their "Cost Of Revenue".Typically asset expenses, if tangible would be expressed in a seperate line item under "depreciation" and if non-tangible similarly under a seperate line under "amortization".However, because content is the main factor driving revenue generation for netflix it would be included in COGS (cost of revenue).Like if I remember correctly a manufacturing company depreciates manufacturing equipment under COGS. Which is the parallel im drawing from my very rudimentary understanding.Edit for confirmationConfirmed, I just googled "when can amortization be included in cost of revenue". Literally the last paragraphhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wallstreetoasis.com/forums/depreciation-in-cogs-and-ebitda%3famp
   pablopatel: Help me, help you. It can‚Äôt be understood.
   simplegdl: You have to use the metrics together to understand their performance. One or the other is useless.
   pxrage: it means they are progressively spending more money to get money.yes you can sort of look it as way of R&D..comparison to intel: hitting moores law ceiling and must spend considerably more R&D dollar to improve their product line without raising cost to the consumer.netflix: they need to up their original content spending by $$$$ to ensure users don't jump ship to other streaming services.

They throw money at the problem, they don't give a shit about profit margin on each show that they're greenlighting, and eventually, they go bankrupt.>Analyst downgrades will also be coming soon and I think there is a good case to be made for a sentiment shift towards bearish.First bit of sense you've made so far.>You gambling degenerates might want to take a look at shorting this thing down to a more reasonable valuation.Nope on the "reasonable evaluation", Netflix will be bankrupt or bought out in 20 years. NVIDIA will still exist. You can't have a profitable company taking out $8 billion ***a year*** for programming on $200 million "profit", AND lose subscribers.Source: AMD fanboy, I know my enemy, and LTT's WAN show won't allow me to forget about them. NVIDIA is a hardcore hardware company with more asians with PhDs than Netflix has woke braindead austistic bronies/alt pansexual female writers. FFS when 10% of your traffic is an NBC sitcom for literally a decade, you've got a problem with expanding the viewership.
   realister: Last July 2018?  Netflix $NFLX missed revenue estimates and lowered guidance and opened down even more than it's down now.  Gapped down 13%+ but then rallied more than 9% from open to close to finish down just 5% on the day.

   AndrewBourke: Noob question: How does shorting a stock change the price of said stock?
   T0mThomas: ER wasn't even bad beyond the abysmal subscriber growth - and that didn't seem to hurt revenues or net income.I think you'd need to see at least a few quarters of this subscriber bleed before you could conclude any of that. Could just be an anomaly.You still can't get everything Netflix has from any one provider. You'd have to get like Disney, Crave, HBO, Hulu - and how many smart TVs have support for all that? I don't think Netflix is falling off the top any time soon.
   IceShaver: Pretty much every software company that trades above 5-10x revenue with few exceptions are going to be the next nvdia. Companies like roku shopify however will be 2x ndias

   Ragepower529: I was on FaceTime with a friend and she told me I should watch Coco it's on Netflix. I asked her does it look like I have Netflix money and she replied yeah 15.99 is getting ridiculous then a shared my gomovies . tube account with her 13$ for 3 months that includes everything streaming services have. I only have hbo go from my att phone plan which I'm about to ditch for Xfinity wireless 45$ a month unlimited data.

   uneasy-existence: Also, I think one way you can bend the rules is by filing a Form 4 with the SEC afterwards. Unless you're an exec or other big player you're not required to file it, but you might be able to optionally file one with your employment options being exercised and then others could look up such details on it.
   hearthebell: why mod is stickying this garbage?
   autoarguebot: When two companies negotiate large deals, people often jump ship to help buy a smaller footprint. I suspect cash reserves were more robust at your place, maybe the workforce was younger, healthy. Lots of things waaaay outside of a worker's view (as opposed to an exec's view) is in play.
   hangingbacon: does it start with A?
   Loner-anger1986: I really don't want to get in trouble, and at this point a ban is fine, I'd rather keep my job and options.  I am just wanting to know if telling you guys about it is legal because I know things that are coming and have now said so. If I had to guess I'd say it's perfectly fine to link the press release, and tell you we are going to do incredible things next year, but I've been wrong before, and this could cost me my freedom, or worse, my job. I have been in the industry for MANY years and worked for the same Team the whole time. Maybe delete or ban me, I was just asking for somewhat honest advice on a situation that could be dangerous for me. Probably the wrong sub to ask in....Still love you fucking freaks though. You sick fucks make this fun if nothing else. Who needs money anyway.

   ExtremelyQualified: Everybody calling for a December repeat because SPY went down less than 1% today: you‚Äôre nuts. The fed put is in. Unless Powell suddenly pulls an interest rate cut off the table, things are not significantly going down based on earnings. Bad earnings would be even more reason to cut a full 1/2 point. Don‚Äôt fight the Fed.

   NoftScarlet: I feel like I paid NFLX $500 to get my ass fisted
   winkerpack: Netflix only has 1 season of impractical jokers and doesn't have the wolf of wall street. Of course they are going down.

   jimbob1911: MSFT going to moon tomorrow. Still lots of large companies making the move to the cloud. Finally enough support for enterprise needs. AWS was first to market with a lot but Azure has some compelling offerings and this year is the year of the ‚Äúhybrid multi cloud‚Äù.  Enterprise is basically buying all of the clouds each for the parts they do well and tying everything together with APIs.  It an even better play long term but pretty sure we are going to see a huge increase from Azure.

   iiiiiiiiiiii: Wall Street expected Q2 subscribers to rise by 5.06 million, Netflix reported just half this number, or 2.70 million, which in addition to a far weaker than expected 2.825mm intl subs, domestic subs actually declined by 126K in Q2 to 60.1 million, a sharp slowdown from the 9.6 million paid net subscribers added in Q1.
   A-DAWWG1G: Hahah autist being murdered out here
   WSBConsensus: Netflix Inc (NFLX) Q1 19 (USD): EPS 0.60 (exp. 0.56), Revenue 4.92bln (exp. 4.93bln) Net net streaming subs 2.7mln (exp. 4.81mln)¬†
   spy400qqq300: Ok so they missed on Q2 subs but are raising Q3 subs guidance to 7m, up from 6.1m subs in Q3 2018. Not sure if overly optimistic or if they have some strategy we don't know about.
   geo0rgi: You need a much bigger subscriber growth and revenue growth to justify that valuation. And that miss is before we see Disney+, Apple TV+ and HBO/ Warner Media get in on the action. Don‚Äôt see better days coming ahead for Netflix, at least not for a while
   Mzavack: KMON NFLX BABY DONT LET ME DOWN
   RocketScientist18: I need to think again fuck. Too much uncertainty also we‚Äôre running out of time. Fuck fuck fuck
   CCPCanuck: Welp, selling puts on nflx is dangerous biz...  Some accounts are not gonna survive this
   spy400qqq300: They're pretty bullish about Q3 adds. Basically they're saying Q1 2019 was so large it affected Q2, hence why Q3 forecast is high at 7m&#x200B;*"We think Q2‚Äôs content slate drove less growth in paid net adds than we anticipated. Additionally, Q1 was so large for us (9.6m net adds), there may have been more pull-forward effect than we realized. In prior quarters with over-forecasts, we‚Äôve found that the underlying long-term growth was not affected and staying focused on the fundamentals of our business served us well."*

   2_uber: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBMmieqMvdU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBMmieqMvdU)&#x200B;Earnings call released
   PetetheJuggler: This shit‚Äôs gonna tank. But I wanna see what the rest of WSB says so I can inverse.

   Droidvoid: Lol people here wanting it to die are only saying that so they can validate their reasoning for missing huge run-ups in NFLX. I remember it was at 50B cap and I told myself, ‚Äúnah this shit is way overvalued‚Äù then it proceeded to triple in valuation in like 3 years.
   Jhiaxus40: Just put $300 7/19 puts for .13. I hope it stays this low so I can snatch a few K.
   jaderin: I guess huge miss on the subscriptions is the reason. Gained 2.7M vs Estimated 5M. Missed by 50%... I think Netflix is hitting growth wall at this point, losing bunch of popular show like The Office / Friends / Disney stuff to some other streaming services like HBO max and Disney+
   originalmuggins: This needs to be stickied
   TinFoilHat_9001: Who's holding what contracts? whats the consensus.
   WilliamNyeTho: my god its brought qqq down a quarter percent
   grinningarmadillo: I wonder if increased Q3 guidance is enough to salvage the share price
   TequilaTrader: Funny to read this from before er to after.
   HIVnotAdeathSentence: Q2 earnings? It'll be up for Q3 if only because of Stranger Things.I'd follow my logic, but I'm priced out.
   Ninenine222: I've had resistance on NFLX around $316.61 on the 12 month: 1 day chart and that's about where it stopped. If it drops below that, the next one I've got is at $299.79.
   surfinbird: üò¨üò≥üëçüëéüëÄüé¨
   TinFoilHat_9001: yikes.
   A-DAWWG1G: Considering buying tomorrow. Netflix has a tendency to soar the days following earnings.(Shorts covering). A bit confusing how INTL subs missed the mark but they raised the Q3 INTL subs consensus. Weird.
vvvelaxtrummm: ELI5: The Investment Banks picking on the RAILROADS, today
   CharmingSoil: What?A railroad stock missed expectations and the CEO said it was because the economy is affecting his business (ie rail shipments are down due to a broader slow down)The caused the market to expect that other railroads will also perform worse than expected, so people tried to get ahead of that, driving prices lower.Basic stuff, no conspiracy, just how things work, all quite reasonable.
   JonahsGrandma: RRs are going down because ELON is making  economy sedans (aka appreciating assets) that will carry all goods through a series of glorified sewer tunnels without the need for some fat cat railroad conductor.  OBVIOUSLY!
   mrTang5544: wtf is this monopoly shit? who invests in railroads?
   Brosseidon: all in SPY calls then, if its rigged I aint fighting it
   SQ401k: So buy CSX?

   Osprey_NE: I don't even know how they existed for so long.  They made buying video games a hassle.  No I don't want to be bugged about preorders for 5 different things.
   TopDeckPatches: I actually LOL-ed at this, not bad marketing actually. Besides, no point hating on the company, if you think it sucks then just short it.
   Rendenbrandt: I work at best buy and we had to stop price matching GameStop because they're liquidating assets. No profit to be had.
   Kaptajn_Bim: imagin going outside to buy games only to find download codes in the boxes
   TurboEntabulator: Is gamestop really only worth 450 mil?
   gbaby3k: yeah but to be fair this is a pretty solid meme lmao
   tayk47xx: If you keep tweeting at the social media guy maybe he‚Äôll change the entire direction of the company
   VerySuperGenius: Do you think the Gamestop executive meetings involve them trying to find ways to save the company or are they accepting of their fate and are trying to find ways to make as much money as they can while it lasts?
   xStaabOnMyKnobx: Gamestop is America's most elaborate magazine subscription sale business
   FercPolo: This was the freest money in the game since like late 2017.   Hope you guys made money in the GME collapse.
   sudokys: Payback for that motherfucker who almost convinced my mom to not let me buy Call of Duty: World at War because of the gore and language. FUCK YOU I LOVED THAT GAME AND YOU TRIED TO TAKE IT FROM ME. ok i'm done.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW1bkPI8KcLong $ATVI???
   MelkieOArda: From an earnings call a few quarters back, I read that one of their plans to improve foot traffic was more in-store exclusives. So your plan to save your company is ‚Äòsell three exclusive Funko toys‚Äô. That‚Äôs gonna save your company? Amazing.
   jvnk: GameStop is basically a pawn shop for electronics now

   c3534l: "Hey, let's create a social media account for our business!"&#x200B;"Oh, so we can interact with our customers?"&#x200B;"Ew, no. Is that what people do with social media?"
   birthrice: OP: gloating about GameStop being worth a lot less than it once was The social media manager who has nothing to do with trade in prices, or also the future of GameStop:
   Awesometof93: Trading-in games in 2019?Don't think so, you dinosaur.
   worknumber101: Do people argue that GameStop would be in a ‚Äòbetter‚Äô financial situation if it paid MORE money for used games that it usually already has more of than it can sell as is? Yeah, you don‚Äôt get good trade in value because used games don‚Äôt have good value.Now I do believe that GameStop doesn‚Äôt sell used games at enough of a discount, usually only $5 or so off the new price, which is absurd. Usually better to just go to Amazon and get the game new and cheaper than GS‚Äôs used prices anyway.
   DoktorKruel: Where‚Äôs the funny meme where they lay off their witty social media guy because the company is collapsing? I‚Äôd lol at that one.
   Hiei2k7: When you fuck the dividend that hard, we bail out.
   EuphoricCelery: And they could‚Äôve survived with a game streaming platform. Too bad Sony already beat them to it...
   panicproducer_reddit: The ultimate poetic imagery, The Next Blockbuster, GameStop is selling Blockbuster and Chill shirtshttps://m.gamestop.com/product/shirts/blockbuster-chill-t-shirt-small/158444
   Vindole9: I've only had one good experience that I can remember at GameStop in the last 15 years or so. The worst experience however was young me feeling pressured as I was trading in my GameCube with a bunch of games, controllers, and memory cards. When they said it was worth $50 I felt so ashamed because I was literally trading it all in for one game.
   Short-The-Vix: I don‚Äôt understand what the guy responding to the GameStop tweet is getting at. You think a PR guy that gets paid minimum wage gives a shit what happened/happens to gamestop? Good job smartass you really showed him
   soAsian: woah! woah! woah! hold up. what's this GameStop not gonna be in the biz for the next 10 years b.s. GameStop have a thriving t-shirt division. GameStop gonna to the MOON with t-shirt.
   MGsquare: They need to revamp their business model completely if anyone with that much power in the hierarchy even gives a shit about the company. I haven't used their services in over a decade and all I know about them is from people complaining how shitty they are and how they're dying.
   talley89: Making fun of your customers . . . üëç

   WindHero: Isn't our favorite "how do you invest in water" autist long this company?
   frankylumps: I stopped shopping at GameStop last year after having picked up a copy of FIFA 19. The sales associate annoyed me by saying I should have pre ordered the game even though they had plenty of copies in stock. When I went to purchase my copy he then tried to sell me on a pre order copy of FIFA 20. I now buy digital or off of Amazon. Fuck GameStop.
   Ar_to: Online shops are replacing physical copies on game marketr/wallstreetbets: It'S bEcAuSe ThEiR sOcIaL mEdIa GuY
   dankklaus: Stock is down 10% today lol
   Boomer059: The main reason why Gamestop lost all that money was the shift to digital. No reason to go preorder at gamestop when Amazon will have  that shit at your door.
   billiam632: That‚Äôs what happens when they buy up all retail competition, refuse to innovate and get beat out by competitors they can‚Äôt just buy.
   Jive_Sloth: What is the point of this tweet? The guy literally said he has nothing to do with the actual business side of things and the reply is still trying to talk to them like they can do anything about it. Confirmed retard.
   Tanya_Talon: I got calls about 5 months ago, needless to say Barry was wrong
   dbarbera: GameStop PR manufactured some of the "outrage" against Microsoft when they pushed towards only digital downloads. Change my mind.
   Wilsuboi: My girlfriend is trying to get her hands on skyrim for switch. This is Finland so the highest chance to get that is a probably a gamestop or ordering online. They tried to sell her a used copy for 60‚Ç¨ and claimed that was 10‚Ç¨ cheaper than the new price, while at the same time selling a new copy for 60‚Ç¨ in a different store.
   brandonXart_: Gamestop is still in business? Who the fuck is buying games at a store? Do they stop by Tower Records on the way home for an 8-track?
   agtiger: That‚Äôs a shame I lived them as a kid
   daninger4995: Gamestop is terrible.  Trade in prices suck and besides a trade in I don't know why I would even bother getting a game from there as opposed to online.
   Data_Dealer: Gamestop's problem is not the shift to digital, it's their company culture.  EB used to be this awesome place to go hang out with awesome employees.  I would buy everything there cause I liked the employees, they were more like friends than workers.  All those people left shortly after Gamestop took over.  They replaced an awesome workplace environment with a bunch of shills that just pushed subscriptions, bs plans and pre-orders.&#x200B;I'd short them, but I'm too dumb to play options and with my luck their market cap is probably not realistic in the sense that some sort of vulture capitalist would offer to buy them at above market price only to harvest their assets at a profit.
   mcbergstedt: I think they‚Äôll go all-online soon and close all their retail stores. It‚Äôs cheaper and they‚Äôll have a larger selection considering they sell retro games online.
   jimbofbx: I don't disagree with their assessment of where they need to be (basically thinkgeek but also highly game focused) but their stores are pretty sad looking right now and are failing at execution.I went to a GameStop. I felt embarrassed to be there. I took my 7 year old son, he asked if we could leave before even getting to the back of the store. I checked the collectables and t shirts "section". It looked just thrown together.Yet despite all this, it still got reasonable foot traffic. They need to make the store appealing to me and my son (and uh everyone who's an investor apparently) without alienating the people who for some reason still gravitate to the store.I've got shares from a wheel play that went south. Both calls and puts are too cheap to bother selling at this point. I'm just holding, waiting for them to figure things out and also for the the ps5 and psvr2 to bring them revenue as when it's sold out all over town you know GameStop will have the last two available.
   Heightx: I believe GameStop is preparing for a comeback. I think they noticed how stupid they are and how the rise of digital sales cut into their two main profit streams. They are planing to change their stores by offering in more game demos and also a gaming lounge. Like an internet cafe but for gamers. A place where people could chill, pay for the hour for a seat on a desk with a gaming PC/PS4 and play with the boys. I am definitely down for this. It's a pain in the ass for me to bring my PS4 to my university and hook it up in a private or lecture room. Being able to just go to GameStop, book a room/spot and game with my irl friends would definitely be amazing. They are also looking at opening bigger stores that offer tournament type arrangements. That's hella interesting. A local gaming community group could book a time slot and have teams compete. They haven't announced a VR gaming room either but I am definitely sure they will in the near future.
   Cronenberg_Jerry: Might as well pad his resume before it goes under, if he/she can gain popularity before it goes belly up, then when the company goes belly up they can find a new job.
   jastan10: Lol, it made me crack up!
   fadingsignal: I did some cleaning recently and dug up a massive box of PS3 games, some never-played/unopened (some still shrink-wrapped!)  I went online to figure out how much I'd get for the entire box, and realized that the hour of my time to pack it up, drive over there, etc. was twice as valuable as what they'd pay me, so I just saved time and gave them away to someone for free.I never had a good interaction with that place.  Adios.
   bright801: I could sure go for a Baconator right now.

   UndeadYoshi420: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt wield any power in this company!‚ÄùThen why the fuck are you representing them on the Internet?
   vil3nr0b: I need a twenty percent equity stake up front and I will save Gamestop:All cities have broadband of some capacity and expensive rents for storefronts. Folks in cities buy the majority of their games online and have no need for Gamestop. The rest of the country, where the majority do not live have shit for internet. Folks only get updates from physical copies of new games bought at $WMT, no internet other than cell phone, etc.Close all city stores, open up rural stores. Real estate is cheap for rent and purchase. They could even rent games, too. Folks acting like folks in a town of 500 people have the means to buy your shitty $90 digital download package for Mortal Kombat 69 or the internet to download it.

phikapp1932: United Rentals earnings report?
   opiablame: I have no input as to whether this is a good idea or not but yes putting your entire account into a short dated option earnings play is pretty classic WSB.
   GODSandSHITHEADS: hope you bought calls and got your ass sucked
   Vanhandle: Why 7/26? Just go for 7/19, gonna move more plus you can buy more contracts. Just load up
   Iwouldbangyou: Be careful with this one. They could very well have strong earnings but new commercial construction is showing some weakness in the next year. The price movement mostly reflects the forecast, not the past earnings so I would not be surprised at all to see a drop.
   im_fapulous_: just bought three $132 puts for 7/19. Gl brother
   Myack_: What‚Äôs your hunch?
   N3RD_01: URI has an imp move of 6.1%, a 5% move will mean you lose money on those OTM FD'S. Good luck.

Mav2246: Bears are gay and autistic but when it comes to apple maybe not
   HinduHamma: You are an idiot.The brand value of Apple is fucking strong. The cult of apple is stronger than Christianity. Over 1.4b active users for iOS. That's retarded strong given the fact how much premium you have to pay for apple hardware. And it's still growing..What's so special ? Build quality is just superior than your best shitty Android device. They also give a fuck about privacy which is a big deal...that's why Google hardware is doomed for failure. No one is going to buy their phones, smarthome shit, etc etc.People trust apple compared to other tech/hardware giants. It doesn't matter what new better phone comes out. Because it still doesn't hold a candle to the brand value of an Apple iPhone. Who's gonna make new better smartphones that people trust? Samsung ? Just as expensive, nothing special. Hauwei? Lol. Google? Lol. Apple and msft are probably the easiest longs in the market. Every fucking time someone wants to say it's the end for apple! It just comes back stronger. It's going to make new ATHs. It always has, and it always will.Even if there is a recession. They have a ridiculously strong balance sheet and a bigger cash pile than god.

   TheRealRogers: Why do QQQ puts when you can do SQQQ calls. &#x200B;It's like extra free money.
   JimCramerSober: Seems like you actually know what you're doing, why not trade the futures NQ or ES?
   WhipTheLion: Mods make this a **shitpost**, where I literally outline a legitimate system where you can turn $5k into $650k in 25 trades, on ATM $QQQ options. &#x200B;Welcome to Wall Street Bets.&#x200B;Fucking hilarious.&#x200B;That said, I'll put some $ in an account for August 1st, JUST for that one pattern, and not trade anything else but that one pattern, and I'll post every trade's results, until that's $100k. Maybe at that point someone goes, 'maybe the weird old autistic pattern guy is right'...

Gilbertgodfries: My all time favorite inspiring quote from Bill Gates
   RedPillCafe: Why would I listen to the world's THIRD richest man. Fucking loser.
   zerodc4213: I actually remember when bill gates said this.  I thought it was incredibly insensitive to the gay community but still respected him for having the balls to say it.
   Al_Freddy_Newman: My favourite Bill Gates quote: "We will never need more than 640K of RAM"
   def_notta_cop: Yea I‚Äôm gonna listen to some nerd w glasses. Right.
   autoarguebot: He shows up in public now and then without money for ice cream. Stood in line, ice cream in his hands, no money. The next time I saw him he was staring at a menu at a fastfood place.

   Ned_Flanderz: Maybe use that money to purchase an education
   OrangesAreOrangeHa: On the bright side, this should help reduce you tax burden
   Gilbertgodfries: And why the hell did you do that? The 'tism flows strong with you. ü§§ü§§ü§§
   bf0111: Nah if we buy you'll never learn
   cainxala: 526 ask no bid. I bought one. Hope its yours. Stay strong.
   boo_hag: Holy shit, that's absolutely fucking retarded and I got margin called in May after selling puts on NIO.
   Houst10: If we all buy a few we can save this man
   Raskalnekov: This is a pretty good learning experience. Never buy a stock with the ticker of a misspelled movie character.
   jhowe13: I just bought 5. Only a few more to go bud!
   seaybl: I‚Äôve got 25 NIO $4 calls. 8/16 expiry. Let‚Äôs see some pump from China.
   Elongated---Muskrat: They dont even make their cars bro, also they can make stuff up on their SEC forms cause the worst consequence is a desisting from Nasdaq and US ban
   eLGuru2: Ban
   boyinliu: FYI, NIO isn‚Äôt going to get close to $6. Literally white gloves in China reaping off optimists...
   oreverthrowaway: oh no.. Is this my future when November comes...
   AriusWraith: How much did they cost you?
   Ibeepboop87: How much you pay for them? I will buy
engineermark: $QQQ Major put volume yesterday
   spxto1500: *degenerate gambler bets a lot of money*WSB: "what do they know?"
   Deeztendies: Just me hedging my position
   Space_Quixote: Shit. I meant to buy calls.
   Small_Cock_Simon: Is Tesla in QQQ
   FatCaddy: YOLO
   Camel-Kid: H E D G E
   centosanjr: earnings is next week for majority of QQQ so iunno
   penny2129: A large tech distributor, Arrow, reported earnings and it wasn‚Äôt good. Q2 Earnings expectations for most of tech are that they won‚Äôt be great, and no one knows for sure when they‚Äôll be back on track.
   mehman11: Gamma roll off after opex friday
   TriLamSr: How do i view activity like this?
   QQQmeintheass: Fuck me
   1poundbookingfee: This is the top. Friendship ended with bull. Bear about to become best friend
   APHAbaghodler: OI like that means they're going long QQQ.

   acej23fun: I‚Äôm sure they will beat.  Banks have been.
   Trece13Trece: Did you make the trade or are you just postin for shits sakes? Gainz Or gtfo.
   notabot_v1: Holding 10 7/19 $32 Calls, bought today at $0.40, could have got in at $0.35 if I waited.&#x200B;...Also 891.95 shares w/ price avg of 28.17.  &#x200B;It's worth $34+. Whether or not it gets there anytime soon is another story -- banks have disappointed me all week. Also holding substantial JPM and BAC shares both of which even w/ earning beats yesterday and today are just kind of floundering w/ the market this week.
   jokely: Thanks for lunch money on this trade!
Litquidity88: Betting on the political elections
   nbkutz: Cleaned up betting on Don back in 2016. Overall winner, and on individual states where he was the moneyline dog (OH, FL, PA, WI, MI)edit: in true WSB fashion I lost it all over the next year betting on college football
   Zirathustra: Literally never bet on politics unless you don't give a single shit about any of the candidates. Nothing warps peoples' perceptions of reality like politics.
   I_Know_KungFu: Trump gonna win and I can‚Äôt stand the guy. Personally, I‚Äôm waiting for the debate with Biden where he says ‚ÄúPersonally, I like my president to *not* have their dead son‚Äôs wife bang his other son, but that‚Äôs just me.‚Äù
   love2fukmarriedwoman: If mango  is in danger of not getting relelectedI'm pulling all my money out.
   antifrgl01: Kind of wish I could run for office have a near certainty of winning(gambling odds) then bet super heavy against myself before dropping out of the race
   rektamo: What even are Democrats
   dopamine_dependent: That's actually a pretty good.  I'd take 50/50.  It's 45/55 on predictit.org right now.  But, you're limited in how much you can bet.
   Log_9: Is Rapinoe running?
   antifrgl01: Could you do me a huge solid and tell me how the +### odds system works
   iamnewnewnew: I never understood what +xxx meant.How come it's not in ur standard odds format? What does the +/- numbers mean?
   storm8ring3r: or buy $AOBC
   totallynotmusk: Trump will not be re-elected.
AnxoBastos: Levi stock -6% Its a buy for long?
   pxrage: "inventory overhangs"they're fucked obvi.
   IceShaver: Legacy 0 growth company focusing on a very competitive market with pretty much only a single product that has low margins. It‚Äôs a yield based company and it will trade based on its yield. At 18x PE ratio this shit still seems crazy overvalued.
   wasserkocher: The stock is in a downward trend and has been for quite some time. If you try to pick the bottom of stocks like this, you're going to end up with smelly fingers. Better to wait for confirmation of a reversal before entering.
   in-the-money-monkey: Buy the dip retard
   sebflippers: Pants are a thing of the past. Buy puts.
   Wallstreet_Fox: If your looking for knives to catch, go CSX.
   JonahsGrandma: I've been a lifelong wearer of the 501 STF until about last year. The quality and consistency has dropped so much over my lifetime - and I think with the recent developments that will only be accelerated. They offer the Made and Crafted line (that has the quality and consistency for which the entire brand was once known) but the products in that line are 8x the cost. Yes, it is an iconic brand, but unfortunately I don't see it dominating the market like they have in the past. Way too much good competition in the market (with way lower overhead, better products and lower costs).
   pooopydooop: Go woke go broke.
   IrregardlessOfFeels: I mean these Goodfellow target pants for $19 have lasted longer than a lot of the Levi's I bought lately for $40-60. There's probably a reason they went public after a century. I bought 514's for the longest time but now cheaper shit fits better and lasts longer so fuck Levi's.
CantHonestlySayICare: Why would anyone be long on Uber?
   pxrage: because their lil side hustle called Uber-EATS. it's wildly profitable and doesn't have all the shitty you might get molested / killed issues that comes with ride sharing.Dominos just got fucked in the ass and their CEO blamed "third-party delivery" like a fucking bajilion times on the call. so democratizing delivery has a huge impact on the food industryAlso Uber has this giant invisible elephant in the room that one day they'll roll out self-driving cars and say bye bye to all their shitty drivers.I'll give it 6-10 years before this is the ONLY option available. they just have to survive that long
   sidestruggle: I've used uber and uber eats and rarely had an issue with either. Uber itself has always been roughly half the price of a cab when I do need to use it to get to-from an airport.Not everyone has time or the care to look through the local hot little taxi service but UBER is usually there and it's even more convenient if you already have the app. These guys have convenience locked down if you travel or rarely need a cab.When is the last time you heard someone say "we can take a taxi" ... Or lyft or any other brand. It's always been UBER.This isn't much of an argument on why to go long but it is my experience with them. If anything, I doubt they are going to disappear anytime soon when their name has permeated our language.
   yuckfoubitch: Because dummies like you think they‚Äôre the smartest autist in a room full of autists and write posts about why Uber won‚Äôt kill it in the long run
   MoneroFuture: ROBOTAXI
   VValrus54: Bc it‚Äôs cheaper than a taxi and an ambulance
retupmocomputer: Why FOMX should be your next pharmaceutical yolo
   SFWonlyCloudDEV: Theyve been in operation since 2014 and since 2016 it's been a downward fall, seems retarded. I'm going to buy $50 yolo shares because you use pretty wordsLets be real their 2020 annual revenue is estimated to come in between $15M and $75M, with an average of $37.21M. Even the highest estimate of $75M is about half of what Retin-A pulled in its first year. Even if the analysts are correct, the 2020 estimate of $37.21M with a 5x price-to-sales would give us a share price of about ~$3.30 per share. Considering the current share price is around $2.30 per share, I am predisposed to see FOMX as a speculative buy. So sure buy in now, but realize the charts are very bearish and you'll probably be able to buy in at 2.20-2.25.
   astroyeet: Pretty good DD, thanks. My main question is how does the new drug compare to existing competitors? You mention it being similar to existing ones being a benefit but couldn't it also be a drawback? I guess it doesn't matter if you're getting out before it goes to market though.
   Fftyler12: You're the guy who helped me last year! Cheers!
officialtommywiseau: Good bets against the general economy.
   mortal6: The infinite bull run will continue justly, all those who oppose the divine bovine will be crushed under the weight of progress and economic productivity from now until the end of time. Amen
   Kresche: Get a 4 letter text randomizer, and keep generating tickers until you get some that exist. Do this until you get about 20 real companies, and bet against them with long ass options, truly random sample. Mandatory can't go tits up
   TheLoner001: a long time ago like before the Titanic even, there were a few companies that were absolutely massive for their time (Rockefeller, Carnegie, Vanderbilt, etc). No one thought they could fail but they eventually did and all the guys are dead now IIRC).   Now we‚Äôve come full circle, but this time we know what to expect, Great Depression 2.0 is coming and it‚Äôs time to short all the big boys. Stop being a pussy and go out there and make some tendies, i‚Äôm talking AAPL, AMZN, FB, and if you‚Äôre feeling brave, short NASDAQ.
   yuckfoubitch: Short high yield corporate bonds
   Space_Quixote: Long inverse 3x S&P500 and NASDAQ 100 funds, short 3x S&P 500 funds and NASDAQ 100 funds. Short SPX futures. Hoard gold and other real assets. Stock pile ammunition and MREs. Filter your urine for drinking water.It's the end-times.
   v270: .22 long.
   SentineL-EX: SQQQ
   Negido: LEAP calls into q1 2020 then puts.
   UglyNeckBeard: If you are trying to make the most from a downturn you will have to short somehow, all of which is as risky as options.If you are just looking for low risk ideas there are plenty of options but they won't make a fraction as much as actually shorting would during a downturn.  Typically suggestions are:‚Ä¢ You can buy defensive cyclical stocks like Utilities and Consumer staples.‚Ä¢ You can buy treasuries or treasury funds like $TLT or $GOVT‚Ä¢ *EDIT:* and PM obviously, mostly gold as the others behavior is a little more nuanced.
