I like how L2FMW was saying we were all too bullish on MSFT earlier today and claimed he bought puts. Now he's here pumping MSFT claiming he had calls. Paper trading clown

It's obvious through CRWD's ER success that cyber security is in huge demand by the market for the next 52 weeks at least. Here's two more cyber security stocks presenting earnings in August:\- Carbon Black (CBLK) - ER  8/1\- Zscaler (ZS) - ER 8/29

Gold mooning! Over $1450. Hopefully this ages well.
$4000 in MSFT calls fucking paying off tomorrow! Granted they're mostly for October/January but I'm happy after my gains were wiped out this past week. Going to sell my August ones at open. Praise Nadella.

Selling all my MSFT calls at open and going back to trying to blow myself
How many here don't trade futures and just look all night long like retards
That MSFT call was so upbeat it has me scurred about muh rate cuts a little bit.
What happened to our future?
My MSFT 138 8/30 calls better be printing tomorrow
Today summed up: BULLS FUCK BEARS FOR 198th DAY IN A ROW
Bought some MSFT 140 calls for next week. Curious to see if the jump will outweigh the change in volatility tomorrow
Pump the conference call Papa Nadella
Sell my 299c 7/24 at open. Feel some redemption after buying my puts at ATH last week, wimping out, selling while it was holding 300 and watching SPY tank immediately after. Coulda made a pretty penny. V important to keep hands STRONG.
Sit and shake my head at my MSFT calls
With the recent BA announcement, BA puts literally free money for ER?EDIT: DDhttps://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cer1q6/daily_discussion_thread_july_18_2019/eu5q20m/

Im concerned about how "sticky" CRWD is with customers, according to their CEO
Rh with an UI update taking out the up and down word and replacing them with sideways arrows....Omg
Listening to this conference call everything is growth, increases and record numbers. Glad I ended up buying calls on Microsoft.
Imagine when big daddy Bezos reports?Bears will be extinct
I might be deaf but I'm pretty sure I just heard a caller drop the F-bomb on the COF earnings call.
OUTLOOK INCREASE!
Guidance seems good. Should pump more.
Great gains in gold today. All I can think of is that sweet capital gains tax the gov must been drooling over
(•_•)  ( •_•)>⌐■-■  (⌐■_■) $140
Do the wheenie helicopter since I loaded up on spy calls on the dip. Thanks wsb for throwing risk management out the window!
Fukkkin damm, Spy covered some distance from dip today.  Don’t fight the Fed folks
At this rate MSFT call holders might actually make money 😅🤑
Fucks going on rn..
Never doubted the gayness of futures traders for once
Has the FED ever cut when the market was at an all time high?
Dreading tomorrow. I dunno what to do till the next MSFT ER. There is nothing else that compares, except maybe WM. Just buy calls far out and make money. This is unfair.
I’ll be happy with a 5% from MSFT
Inb4 75bp rate cutBc why not 😎

So still holding some MSFT 139c, expiring next week. That was a sure thing but I’m down like 35%.  I also bought some CHWY stuff on a whim. $50 calls for October... I’m up a bit for those. I dunno what I’m doing
I’m closing all my positions, except maybe gld short puts, and sitting a few days out. Killed it last week. Killed it again this week barring my adderal fueled trades Monday. Need to take a few days off before I yolo something dumb again.
Yo this MSFT conference call has some tight music
It started

All I need is a sweeet China pump
Collect my tendies from put credit spreads on MSFT and cash out on 8/2 139C. Played this one perfectly
Cry about WMT FD's. I abandoned ship at the bottom today. My calls finished in the green, good thing I sold them while they were red.
anyone know why $ATVI is up after hours?
Has guidance been postedEdit: for msft u degens
Gotta love that reverse rug pull!  Whose account is at an all time high as well right now? Feels good Gold Bros.
Oh shit … CRWD's earnings call has the stock at 80.90

Pray to the lords that gold doesn't lose its mind again.. Sorry everyone
why is BA up so much AH? and how are futures down so much when everything is up??
I might get a tendie or two from my spy calls tomorrow. What's my next play?
Holding LDOS, SPLK, MDT calls. Not sure what’s going to happen to my CHWY put yet.
i hope y’all got out of your gold calls 😂😂
Amazon 2k at open pls
If we touch 300 on SPY tomorrow… You better start averaging into puts.
Be sad that my $10,500 in 0day ORCL puts have to die in order for my $11,500 in 0day ORCL calls to have a chance to liveee.RIP
25bps confirmed. 50 would have been overkill. If market goes down on a 25bp cut because they're asking for a 50bps, to me it's a perfect BTFD opportunity!
I didn’t think $MSFT would tickle 140 today, do I still immediately sell my 7/26 140c at open tomorrow?
Why futures turned red&#x200B;[https://www.forexlive.com/centralbank/!/new-york-fed-says-williams-speech-potential-policy-actions-at-the-july-fomc-meeting-20190718](https://www.forexlive.com/centralbank/!/new-york-fed-says-williams-speech-potential-policy-actions-at-the-july-fomc-meeting-20190718)

May Allah bless MSFT and Bill Gates
My only advise to anyone playing earnings, besides not fucking doing it, is to buy AT the money  at least a month out. Good luck, retards.

I just want to make $4MM quickly is that so much to ask...?
I think I’m gonna start Martingaling earnings. Bet $100 and lose? Bet $100 again. Lose? Bet $200. Lost again? Bet $400. Lost again? Bet $800. Eventually I’ll get one right and who knows maybe on the $800 bet the option will go 10x
Roku long or short?
Nothing. Watch what remains of my 7/19s disappear from my account at close. Hope my August plays continue to work.

HA! CRWD got asked if the Symantic/Broadcom merger fall through had customers fleeing to them. CEO played it right ... "we just keep trying to build the best end point technology possible"&#x200B;Also, they made some points on pushing CRWD into more international markets, and going IPO gave them more attention. Hmmm...

MSFT is going to smash earnings guys.  I work in SaaS - they have assumed complete control with O365, Azure, and Teams.  Workplaces are lagging if they don't use the above.
If I short the stock, then cancel my Netflix subscription, is that considered insider trading ??
Take a moment to remember all of us who sold way OTM put spreads on NFLX cause easy money. Looks like I'll be taking a 14k L today.
Can we not let Netflix kick off earnings season next time?
Does anyone else feel like the second they look into how their options are doing for the day they always start to trend down?

Alright. I just deleted Robinhood, a good portion of my account is in Microsoft calls, calls in general. My hopes? That Microsoft crushes earnings with guidance that makes 07 Lohan seem like the next Michelle Obama, moons, and instills fresh hope within investors all across the market bringing it in tow.Now I’m going to have a nice worry free day. Watch some Designated Survivor, have a nice lunch and dinner, play some games. When I come back I will find myself several thousand dollars richer or poorer. Godspeed to you all.
Good thing about going down 50% on spy calls is that when it goes down again I lose less than I would’ve if I was up on them. Crazy how percentages do that

Raymond James upgraded Apple and this is their thesis “Our call may well be early – we expect this year’s iPhone cycle to be the weakest in years, and today may not be the right time to buy ahead of that weakness. But since the near-term market moves are being driven by macro conditions as much as fundamentals, we’ve decided to upgrade now and let our clients decide the best time to execute on our idea.”LolAlso upgraded because of "5g"

Don't fuck up today. Think before you stonk.
I got fkn wrecked the past two weeks, down 20k, my life savings was 30k, haven’t told anyone yet. My main problem was that I was winning every trade for way too long, I had no real idea of what my actual risk tolerance was. I started playing with way too much money and couldn’t handle the intra-week losses so I ended up with very weak hands, then I started trading on tilt and chasing stupid trades.I’m not gonna kill myself, I just needed to tell someone because I’m too embarrassed to tell my gf or parents.If you haven’t felt 40-50% losses yet, do not increase your net, because you don’t know how weak your hands are until you start watching your life savings evaporate.My last 6k is in a 7/26 spy 300c, currently down 400.
Cammon Raymond James: “We feel that offering 5G at lower price points will drive a stronger product cycle, and early production plans tend to confirm that view”1) have no idea about price points (all confidential). knowing Apple, will not be cheap2) publicly released statement of Q4 20203) early production plans that they also have no idea aboutCan we fucking band together and make a WSB firm where we do zero DD and release these retarded statements with outrageous price points? Who the fuck even hires analysts or pay them anymore? Like Buzzfeed tier reporters
Oh yeah, $PM. Finally my carcinogenic racehorse is back in the game.
Did SPY futures just go green?!

Why in the fuck would you whine about Netflix instead of just rolling over to Disney. Subs dead my ass, quit bitching and let's make that bread.
big money is gonna ease out of netflix, notice how all the analysts are reaffirming their buy ratings but none of them saw this drop coming in the first place? Just talking up their book giving them time to liquidate
How do I buy puts on my liver for this weekend if tomorrow goes poorly?
Holy fuck if MSFT trades sideways this sub is gonna long $ROPE itself

So I lost ALL my gains holding $SPY 7/19 $300c - this week. Sold those when it hit $297.5 and Switched to 7/19 $300p and lost even more. I guess my GREAT week turned into a SHITTY week in two trades. AMA, I'm a pussy.

Can someone explain to me why analysts are giving out price targets for free? If it’s legit, quality research shouldn’t we have to pay for it? There’s an old saying. If you aren’t paying for something, you are the product. This applies to facebook(your user data), girls entry into bars(their asses) and financial instruments(leading retail retards to buy and sell).

Why is Microsoft going down
I’m gonna laugh when msft hits 133 then pops up 3% so both call and put holders are screwed.
MSFT take my energy
Everything on my watch list is red
if MSFT misses, is it going to b recession?
Well I was green for a whole hour this time, that  counts as an improvement
This sub is either broke or rich tomorrow

said we would end flat at like noon today
In all seriousness, can someone explain how NFLX trades within a 0.3% range all day after dropping 11% over night? Like no large money abandons and no large money buys the dip? There's $140 billion dollars in this company how does it barely move?

Picked up some AMD 8/16 $32p when it hit $34.70. Hoping to really see some returns today... Sadly I sold SPY 7/26 $298.50p before the dump and could have doubled my money.
u/GeoDudeBroManOil what do you think about buying calls for next week while it's under 12? Seems like this might be the dip assuming Pompeo keeps his mouth shut.

7/26 AMD calls or SPY calls?  🤔
Morgan Stanley raises Chipotle $CMG to price target to $700 but doesn't upgrade its rating to "overweight" from "equal weight". If they are so bullish on Chipotle and raising the price target to $700 why maintain an equal weight rating, why not also give the stock an overweight rating like other stocks they are bullish on? I wonder if the analysts were asked to not rate the stock "overweight" to avoid the potential jokes and PR hassle from associating the fast food restaurant with the word "overweight" in any capacity or context.

SBUX is such a pesky stock staying up here.. But I'm pretty sure it's getting crushed on earnings if it does not pull back a bit into them. What's even the bull case? $BECKY I know.. But besides that? Stagnant revenue, over priced product no one wants in a recession, fucking $0.19 stock like 10 years back and now $90.50? Up 100% in a year, what? Has Starbuck's prolithicy increased 2 fold in the last year? Because their earnings sure as shit haven't.. Gimme a break, print tendies with my Aug 30th puts please.
gotta wheel strategy the fuck out of MSFT here. I'll take shares at 131.70 if I have to.
Multi cloud strategy is my DD for MSFT earnings. Lol who am I kidding... gambling 2k on MSFT calls.4k or bust
was at 4k at 945 am on ebay 39.50 calls now I'm at 500. Wtf is this shit
we’re finally going to the moon, anon, y-you didn’t buy puts, right? you never doubted the bull market, right desu?
$NFLX calls for sure right?
Spy puts at close? 🤔
Up 25%  overall on calls switched to puts and down 5% overall. Bear Gang has not been kind to me since Dec 24
Looking at our markets and thinking: “Yeah, now’s the time to buy!”
I'm gonna  buy more MSFT calls here. I'm pretty sure this is the bottom from my TA
Spy 299 EOW please
Any other ER plays today/tomorrow besides MSFT?
I’m going to wait until I’m done making my YOLO earnings plays and hop back into some Netflix puts. I think it’s going to bleed until next quarter.

Who’s holding MSFT calls? I’ve got some $139 expiring 7/26, down almost 35%. Plummeting off a cliff and hoping for an amazing earnings report tomorrow
Everybody calling for a December repeat because SPY went down less than 1% today: you’re nuts. The fed put is in. Unless Powell suddenly pulls an interest rate cut off the table, things are not significantly going down based on earnings. Bad earnings would be even more reason to cut a full 1/2 point. Don’t fight the Fed.
Im going back to penny stocks fuck this
Congrats on your yatchs for those who bought puts on Netflix.
so how much will my $455 NFLX calls be worth?
Goodbye everyone it’s been fun, I’m going to mcD and I’ll be back in  30
Man, if MSFT misses or Azure doesn't meet growth expectations - it's gonna be brutal here.&#x200B;Don't go all in boys. I have plenty of friends at software/data companies that anecdotally say their business's are slowing, which means less spending on their cloud services.
I feel like I paid NFLX $500 to get my ass fisted
Netflix only has 1 season of impractical jokers and doesn't have the wolf of wall street. Of course they are going down.
Nice $10k worth of NFLX puts is now worth around $80,000 not me of course, I had calls
So let me see if I understand:The economy is simultaneously doing so well that it’s crazy to lower interest rates and yet so terribly that if we don’t lower interest rates, everything will fall apart.
Who sells their shares. Lol why do stocks go down. Just buy and hold forever. We'd all be rich
If there’s anything we’ve learned from futures this week, it’s that they don’t mean shit
WSB finally bearish. Thank god, I thought my calls were dead in the water
When the market takes the stairs up, it takes the elevator down. This last 6 months, it took the elevator up. So I guess we take the window down.
Chickened out of buying NFLX puts... "*to win without danger is to win without glory. The same is true of Fortune. She seeks out the bravest men to match with her, some she passes by in disdain."*
Maybe if I play Bulls on Parade enough I’ll trick the market into being bullish.
Every single day, futures have been way more optimistic than the regular market. What’s up with that?
I overheard a few retards mention wallstreetbets while I was at the supermarket today.What the f#ck is happening? This shit shouldn't be leaking into the real world where I live my real life with real people!

WELPPpppppppppppppim ded. question is how ded am i. sold 2 NFLX 320p's.  (and 2 420c's). if it stays around 320 range then shiet ill be fine. but if it tanks further then oh god rope is ready. (+ im prob going to buy the dip)
Does the fetal position count as a move?
How the hell is NFLX going to convince people that they're going to get 9+M new subs next quarter when this quarter was so shit?
-5k on the week. Killing it
They should make Robin Hood app look like an arcade machine. When you lose all your money it should read: "game over, insert coin to continue"

Sold my NFLX $350 aug 16 puts for QCOM calls before EOD. What shit luck haha
Opened up a spreadsheet today. Looked at P/L from all brokerage accounts. Officially down $8.5k in 8 months. Its been real brothers and sisters. Time for a break. See you guys Monday morning sharp.
Guys, not to be condescending, but if you don’t understand why Netflix, a 160b company, is moving the market after choking subscribers that bad...you need to re-evaluate your approach to trading. We are not going to have some miraculous rally to all time highs tomorrow - or anytime soon. God help us if Microsoft misses.
Watch my account hit zero most likely. Getting destroyed on DIS MSFT USO calls at the moment.
Mickey gang!!HEY MICKY U SO FINE OMG U BLOW MY MIND HEY MICKEY
In July 2018 Netflix $NFLX missed revenue estimates and lowered guidance and opened down even more than it's down now.  Gapped down 13%+ but then rallied more than 9% from open to close to finish down just 5% on the day.  Have faith.
Mr market, I don’t feel so good.
1.) Throw my money at the market. 2.) Watch the line go down.3.) Come back to WSB and feel better about myself
Any of y’all carrying NFLX puts? I’m surprised I don’t see more celebrating from put holders
Sold my MSFT 130C Jan calls on that first pop today. Seems like that was the right decision. Still holding one 115C for January, but looking to enter more after earnings.
Is Netflix even in the s&p
Nasdaq mini don't give a fuck about no streaming bois
Sitting on MSFT 138, 139 AND 140 C. Thinking I might grab more tomorrow,  depending how it's opens, ITM.  If it crushes,  I'm buying a yacht, if it misses, back to work for another year. Thoughts????
Remember buying NFLX puts around March and watching Hastings’ smug ass raise subscription prices saying they’ll never lose subscribers. Fuck i hope NFLX sinks to the ground just because I lost a petty 1k on that shit company.
If the market could pull a 2015-16 and double bottom off Dec’s lows that would be a fun play.
sooo DIS calls tmrw ?
Anyway...looks I'm holding MSFT through earnings, cool
Semiconductor fears back due to China? AMD fell off a cliff...

MSFT going to moon tomorrow. Still lots of large companies making the move to the cloud. Finally enough support for enterprise needs. AWS was first to market with a lot but Azure has some compelling offerings and this year is the year of the “hybrid multi cloud”.  Enterprise is basically buying all of the clouds each for the parts they do well and tying everything together with APIs.  It an even better play long term but pretty sure we are going to see a huge increase from Azure.

Tomorrow’s my birthday so someone pick me a winner
Ran into the guy who told me to get into stocks. He bugged me about it for a while and yesterday was the first time I’ve seen him since I started donkin’ off money. So I asked him how his stocks are doing.“Well I put 250k into BYND on IPO day so...”He said his broker really tried to talk him out of it, too, hahaMust be nice!
Anyone else notice that 1,179,744 share purchase for FB right at close? Thoughts?

How many of you are joining $ROPE-gang after NFLX earnings?

How autistic am I for wanting to pick up some DIS calls solely based on NFLX shitting the bed?
JNJ is recession proof stonk yes
This earnings season for me so far: 1. WFC.  I had calls. BIG miss. :( 2. EBAY. Have 8/16 40calls. Hit! What I will certainly be playing. 1. I *will* buy at least one atm put on STMP this time!!! Don't care if I lose money on this. 2. Credit spread on IRBT for apocalyptic IV crush. 3. XLNX. Don't know how yet. 4. Iron condor on MSFT... 142/143 and 134/133 .  Probably will tweak tomorrow, seeing how things play out. 5. TWLO credit spreads, probably both directions (i.e. iron condors)and much more!
RIP FAANG. LONG LIVE FAAMG. YOU'RE OUR ONLY HOPE.
Writing Calls watching half the retards who have never seen a week of consecutive red shit themselves and then post I’m out boys on this sub.
Hmm, should I hold my calls I bought today until they expire at the end of the month, or switch back to puts so the market doesn't tank?I guess I'll land at 0 either way. May as well go back into puts and save the market
If you are not trading options in your IRA in addition to a taxable account, then you must hate money. Imagine how sweet your tendies will taste after marinating for 30-40 years in a tax sheltered account 😋
Swear to baby Jesus, that if $UNH fucks me tomorrow...ima...ima...vote for fucking Bernie!
I did some research and re-evaluated my fundamental analysis of NFLX. In order to justify its 138:1 price to earnings ratio, every man woman and child on this planet would have to have watched stranger things season 4 at least twice.The proper valuation at the current financials is $38/share
All wsb thinks we're bearish now. We'll see
pray for didney worl
can we go back to the days where bad news on anything = rate cut = moonpls papa powell, i need like a 75bp cut or something

So I’ve been selling OTM spy credit spreads and losing money now I switch to gold otm spreads and lose money, I’m not even trying to time the market, talk about fkin bad luck
Hope my boy D Trump will end the trade war tomorrow
Damn NFLX was expecting them to beat.  shop puts at ath are printing and my 295 spy puts came back to life.  Anyone who needs a distraction on the other end, don't forget that you will soon be able to short the tool of all your bad decisions after robinhood IPO.  short HOOD
Hope that my NFLX spreads were actually risk-free
Dude if fucking IBM beat MSFT will beat
Pray for MSFT.

Wait a minute, how did this happen? We’re smarter than this.
Gonna figure out how to not get fucked too bad by the put side of my nflx IC. That's a big oof lol.335/325p. Only 3 contracts so max loss of 3k. as it stands it's at about 2.4k loss after premiums.

Wooo RobinHood removed my account restrictions for the after hours $0.68 margin call they got me for yesterday.I wonder how they stayed in business being out all that money for so long
So 1 month after my $6k in NFLX puts expire worthless, this happens. Of course.
If MSFT misses (which would be surprising), it's gonna scare a shitload of people out of the market
I'm telling you guys this pull back after options expiration is gonna be violent
Why didn't I buy Netflix puts?  Apparently because I'm dumb and I don't want to be rich like an asshole.
Should I stock up on meat for the incoming depression or are we all beyond meat now?

We're going green today. If you think $NFLX controls this market, you're insane. What's bad for the flix is good for Jeffrey and the Mouse. And Billy hasn't been known to disappoint on earnings, so I'd expect a pre-report run up there too.Long $MSFT, long $QQQ, long USA

NFLX even upped their sub forecast for next quarter  🤭🤭Next ER might be even more free money assuming they dont tank to the depths where they belong
is this good or bad for DIS. i need my calls to not be in the red
FOMO into Netflix puts
What I have learned from Netflix: Never give up on your puts. If they go down, buy more and further out expiry. If it goes down more, buy more puts. Eventually you will be victorious
Just saw a comment saying MSFT warnings are tomorrow, I only bought cause I thought they were next week like a true autist.Edit: I'm keeping it
Sheesh nflx still projects 7m adds globally for Q3. Not sure if we can believe when they miss projection so badly this time.Edit: reading thru their letter.They are adding in cheaper mobile screen plan to India in Q3 so that'll probably help the 7m I guess.
Bears are back on the street tomorrow if they are still alive.
Any ideas on WYNN? I love to gamble and would like to be the house for once.
Let’s turn this into a mad money game thread at 6pm.
Has anyone taken a peak at Netfucks yet?
If we take a moment and think about market sentiment right now, this is not how it feels before a recession. The word fear comes to mind. SPY didn't break out to 310 immediately after crossing 300 so it must be a recession eh?Not saying it can't happen if MSFT, AAPL, GOOG AMZN start missing too. Just seems premature.
how much do you guys think a 7/26 $345 NFLX put would be worth tomorrow? It's deep ITM now, but how does IV factor in here
Stonks go up or down, but futures always go up. Cant explains that
Fucking hell.  I told myself for weeks to sit these ERs out, but the gains and ATHs went to my head.  I ended up FOMOing into SPY calls and blowing my account up 30%.I just want to get even from December.
I sold some of my msft calls before close. Will probably be down 40% on the remainder tomorrow. Thinking of getting yolo puts as a hedge but I’m real close to blowing up my account. I wish I would listen to myself sometimes.
Ok futures red in cnbc and CNN and green in investing.com which one do I trust
So now the question is … if we think the market is now entering bearish territory... where's the best volatility plays?

If we correct 10% before fed meeting they cut 50% because they do not want to fight off european and Japanese liquidity trap with a financial crisis at home, and a protracted trade war.The Fed does not enough bps to fight all these fronts.  The neutral rate will continue to go lower without global synchronized fiscal and monetary stimulus.The fed cant fight this alone. When they lose the battle, the US enters it's own liquidity trap.

We'll be telling our grand kí̵̤d͢s͇͑͘ about how Spy was at 300 while theyre on the subway to work their 100 hour work week for Toyota, and watch girls eat noodles on YouTube.
Going to do some ketamine and smoke some weed and hopefully fall into an alternative universe where I bought Netflix puts and didn’t AVG down on MSFT calls
NFLX shouldn’t have ever been in FAANG, but people needed an N in the acronym.
I think we will lose 20% of people in this sub tomorrow from netflix
pornhub.com/videos/DIS-spreads-ass-of-callholders
MSFT moonin', but SPY still actin' like a lil' bitch though--almost like it's comprised of 499 other companies or some shit
Red Wednesday means Green Thursday. Its science.
Lets all give a big F to the guy who bought 17000 contracts of $DIS 155 expiring this Friday. Even if that was something institutional you have to admire it.
i dont want to go back to rational stonk market . i want only up and trump pumps forever.
Every fucking day7am: "Maybe today won't be so bad"4pm: "I should have stayed in bed and started day drinking at dawn"
what kind of dip is this? french onion?
Netflix drops by 12%. WSB - Buy the dip bois we cant stay down for long
NFLX announcing gay porn streaming service during the call.  NFLX going to ATH
This week has almost wiped me out, but on the positive side...at least I'm not a $160bn company with a projected negative $3.5bn cash flow and shrinking subscriber growth.  I guess...
Soooooo the question on everyones mindIf Netflix drops out is it FAAG now
So glad all my work bathrooms are private. Get to go in for my 9:30 shit and trade in peace.
my OTM SHOP Calls are now ITM.... this is insane
Thought my PC was updating but turns out I’ve just been watching MSFT graph this whole time
Whoever told us to buy shop puts 2 hours ago. Come get this blowjob
I just cant believe DIS is fucking me harder than JNJ
robinhood let us trade 0 day. The true FD.
How are you enjoying the recession?
I have 50k riding on NFLX and MSFT, I have never been more excited for earnings
Uh oh, i sold netflix puts im dead 😂
Petition to storm MSFT Headquarters, they can’t sell off all of us at once
315 NFLX Puts yeeeeee buddy
GOLD GangWe be lurking just waiting to post gains.For now, we continue to joe Biden our time. Soon gold gang, soon.🌈 ARISE CHIKEN ARISE 🌈🧚‍♂️🥇
DIS and AMZN about to size NFLX out of this market
Don’t worry y’all SPY earnings gonna save us.
Should've know BYND was the only worthwhile company adding value to our lives
Gonna watch all of wsb switch to puts tomorrow before MSFT blows earnings away.You know we good for that
NFLX leading off this round of tech ER was the exact opposite of what the market needed today.  MSFT will stop the bleeding.
Anyone got a remedy for raw asshole?
So much for spy gapping up😵😬
Bloomberg with the P U M P article yesterday, who caught this gem?  [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-16/bullish-u-s-stock-buyers-are-positioning-for-a-giant-windfall](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-16/bullish-u-s-stock-buyers-are-positioning-for-a-giant-windfall) "That means SPY would need to advance at least 34% in 2019 for the max payout to be achieved, a level that hasn’t been seen in more than two decades. But it so happens that the last time it occurred, 1995, was a year in which the Federal Reserve [cut rates with stocks at all-time highs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-18/u-s-stocks-flirting-with-record-pose-no-hurdle-to-fed-rate-cuts), a phenomenon rates traders are expecting to occur again later this month."
today: depression, part 2: BAC edition
RIP to my SPY calls
idk why everyone thought BAC would pop $1 on earning like what
Mr. Market touched me inappropriately
why DIS keep fucking me
Bought some MSFT shares to help turn this dip around and help your calls bois
Whoa when did RH start with the flashing dot. It looks awesome
Is anyone else here straight up retarded?
[deleted]
Turns out good news is finally bad news
What an absolutely shitty weekF you, market
I had $21 LEVI Puts for 7/19 I bought before earnings when I told you guys nobody wears Levi’s anymore. I bought them at 0.2 since they were so far OTM and then sold them at .4. Today they are 2.18, I screwed myself out of a 10 bagger
I just saw PPT leave the White House and get into Marine One. Stand by everyone.
Holy shit, NFLX Call holders on suicide watch
RIP my NFLX iron condor
The one earnings play I guess right is the one I don’t have a position in. Go fucking figure
I think Im rich on NFLX puts...I didnt expect THIS
JNJ stonk up AH because NFLX put sellers and callholders stocking up baby oil
where were you when netflix brought down the global economy
NFLX is going to need one hell of a conference call
>Shares of Netflix fell 10% after the company reported global net adds of 2.7 million, well below guidance of 5 million.LMAO
WHERE MY NFLX PUT HOLDERS AT?? THE FUCKING TENDIES
[deleted]
So much for "Bigly Green" in the poll yesterday
NFLX is currently obviously THE key metric by which all tech companies valuation should be based.  Everything seems to have foundations of sand, I need to know why call credit spreads on pretty much everything for the next few weeks is a bad idea.Honestly MSFT dropping because NFLX fell?  Really?
NFLX📉AAPL 📉AMZN 📉GOOG 📉MSFT 📉FB 📉ADBE 📈🤔
Oh so bad news is bad news now?
NFLX's shareholder letter looks very amateurish[https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc\_financials/quarterly\_reports/2019/q2/Q2-19-Shareholder-Letter-FINAL.pdf](https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/quarterly_reports/2019/q2/Q2-19-Shareholder-Letter-FINAL.pdf)&#x200B;Seems like it was written in microsoft word with default fontsalmost like a middle school reportjust saying
When did NFLX become the indicator for the entire market?
Yo that last minute MSFT drop was not cool
Nflx is going to be my biggest loss yet tomorrow.
So FAANG is now FAAG right?
MSFT IS UP ALL I CARE ABOUT
BAC is so mediocre. What a turn off.
Can tsla to 270?
CRWD this is your time baby
Goddamit BAC why do you have to be so autistic
So is BAC going up or down today?
IV CRASH ON AMD JULY 26 FD
Was promised JNJ 140 by EOD fucking animal yes
Cmooooon MSFT, I need you MEGAHARD today 😫😫😫😫
How did my UAL call from yesterday lose 90% value in a minute?
HEY WHAT THE FUCK!? Robinhood web says only 90% of analysts recommend buying MSFT, the mobile app says 94!! REEE
Got out of MrK 83.5 FD for 50% gains not too shabby
DIS you sneaky bastard 😏
I'm on an overnight test drive with a new Model 3.  Long Tesla boys, this shit is sick as fuck.
Somebody hold me #🧒🏽🤱🏿🙍🏻‍♂️
BAC is killing me
  Did Robinhood just add a dot to the line? This is what they thought needed fixing
It's impossible to tell where TSLA will go after its earnings release. The stock has gone up so much recently that it might have a "sell on the news" event or it might just head up higher if the guidance for the rest of the year is really good (especially if they say they will be profitable in Q3 and Q4). Looks like their China factory is also coming along nicely. One thing that might work against them is that the current quarter's delivery numbers will be very difficult to beat in Q3 and they still have to show some growth since they are a hypergrowth company.
Finally hit peasant gains of 400% on a TSLA call i bought at 177. Barely acceptable returns, but I think I will hold for the 10 bagger
~~blue~~ red apron
COME ON SPY!!U NEED MY 🍆 ENERGY!LETS GO 🐃🐃🐃 GANG.
Dropped 5k into SHOP FD puts too early in the morning. Watched as it went down -70%, now i'm somehow almost back to even. Gonna go have the worst jerk ever with these rock solid hands.
If i deposit 25k into RH right now do i immediately get unlimited daytrades? Or do i have to wait until next day
Why does being down 200 feel like a win? Oh wait, prolly cause being down 500 is normal.
I’m in on 139c $MSFT 7/26. I’m up $9. Most I’ve been up since I lost 4K, lol.

Netflix call holders getting raped. Dry.
Wow Netflix beats ....beats itself
It’s not just Netflix, everything is taking a dump after close.  Although Netflix is outperforming all the other drops.
NFLX 325 puts were 1.11$ each. Worth atleast 5$ tomorrow
I bought QQQ and NFLX puts at close yesterday and they called me a madman
Market red but my portfolio green. Something is definitely wrong.
MSFT is up 36% this year...and autists are still buying OTM calls. Sigh.
netflix is really about to be done for lol. barely beating their eps, burning cash, losing subs like crazy, i like their shows but they’re losing reruns of old hits. it’s done for especially with new competition coming out that have bigger hits than netflix ever had
What’s my NFLX $300P 7/19 going to be worth tomorrow?
I think the Nasdaq will rebound heavily tomorrow
I just checked my history on Shopify and I sold my 7/19 $250 calls for $250/each back in February.... Those are worth $8500 each today lol
RIP to the guy who posted and then deleted his thread about being up 1000% on his APRN 11c that he was going to hold. They're now worth less than he bought them for.
The past 2 times I've been to Dunkin Donuts they have given me a large coffee instead of the small I ordered, and given me 3 donuts instead of the 1 I ordered.  The brown girl that works there either has a crush on me or can't read tickets.Either way, short DNKN.  Can't make money giving stuff away.
TSLA mooning helps me get out today before theta puts a big one in my ass
I love that the media just uses the trade war when they run out if stuff to say"Market treads water as trade woes loom"Uh huhhhhh
M O O N. That spells moon
What’s pumping $ROKU?
BAC sounds healthy. Good shit continuing for the next few months imo
Futures wont even hold till open
CRWD dca 69.69
I wish Trump would grow a pair and actually follow through on his empty threat to China. Need a good dip so I can go back to being a bull

TSLA calls: so easy, a caveman could do it
fuck i got out of $TSLA yesterday for a loss and today its ripping. fuck me
I set my TSLA 265C 7/26 at $8 as a placeholder and within 5 mins someone snapped it up.I made a few hundred profit but I'm really bummed, I didn't actually intend to sell it.
Very nice poo poo SPY you get a gold star for that
Now THIS is podracing
Unpopular Opinion: Cramer’s Get Rich Carefully actually has some good tips. Especially about not indolently buying stock, wait for great news or a major pullback and always try to get a better basis.
I don't feel so good Mr. Bezos 😭
RECCESION confirmed fuck man it’s over
Is now a good time to double down on spy calls 🤔
Ah I see investors are selling SPY to buy into a safe asset like APRN.
LOL IV on netflix is 120% 10000 point move in one direction
I'm sorry I doubted you SQ, but I believed you enough to hold through a 7K loss yesterday.  I think I'm addicted to WSB.
Why didn't I just go all in gold?
This new dot to show me where my losses are in Robin Hood is tits

every central bank talking about negative interest rates. Gold easily to all time highs in next years.
In today’s version of risking a lot to win a little, I just sold $405/$410 NFLX calls expiring Friday
Don't think I am asking for much.  Want stocks to go up when I have calls and stocks to go down when I have puts.
Tesla go to the fuckin MARS
Buy SHOP puts if you like money.
DIS dip seems cool
man trading oil is the worst
I was promised a MSFT run-up to earnings

god i hate oil
#im gay
I used to enjoy this sub, but this week /r/Robinhood has shown lot more enjoyable autism...
imagine having like 6 shares of AAPL and 4 shares of SPY and $200 in cash how much fun you'd have on a day like today manipulating the market so easily with the books so thin
I have a gut feeling nflx gonna go up
Lol I love how 2019 trained me to take profits on puts after a .15% drop thinking that's the best I'd get. Then of course buying calls because SPY almost always rips up from even the slightest of red daysFml
Pump pump pretty pleeze with cherry on top
Puts on Netflix man. Everybody favorite shit is leaving and the rent is too damn high. Also they keep contemplating ads. It's future disaster
Tbh I hope NFLX gets dogged. Stock triggers me with it's irrational movements
Who remembers the bull market?
JNJ this da bottom?
Holy fuck MSFT.
MSFT really just ruined my day lol
I couldn’t help myself. Put a few hundred on a NFLX put.
Finally broke even with TSLA. Now setting a stop loss at $250 and waiting for the ER tendie train. Then hopefully unloading 50% of my bags and let the rest run to $300.
that last 10 minutes was fucking retarded
NFLX drop looks like it made everything drop AH
I came really close to getting tricked into buying Netflix calls by you virgins and I’m glad I listened to my fully formed dick
I bought stonks at the top of the July 2019 bull run AMA

If MSFT falls tomorrow that's the end of the stock market..We all move under bridges and next depression starts
Jezzus look at oil. We gona see a false flag/ refinery boom boom soon. Be ready to buy but not yet
Wonder if anyone bought enough puts on Netflix to become a millionaire

🐻🍆💦💦💦💦🐃💋💄
So basically I won 3K in 2 weeks and lost it all in 1 day. Thanks AMZN and thanks NFLX for fucking with my AMZN calls. I feel like shit for not playing NfLX as I was pretty sure they would tank given that their main competitors released their best series during that period (GoT, Chernobyl, Handmaids tale).
SPY 7/24 300c ded
Bulls getting big gayed in AH.Bout to open <$297 at this rate.
Were a lot of people honestly bullish on netflix?E: i just mean as a user.  I feel like they have declined over time.  I took no positions on netflix either way as I had no good feelings on how it would pan out, but as a customer i've been waiting for a better option over the last 6 - 7 months i feel like.  After they landed those stand up specials, i've lost the lustE2: I loved the stand up specials, but "what have you done for me lately" is how this market acts.
anyone lose their shirt on NFLX calls?
LMAO, watch WSB turn into bears and MSFT still blows earnings out the water
[deleted]
I feel like I need to stop obsessing over what’s gonna happen tomorrow until tomorrow comes. No one knows what’s going to happen until it does. Case in point: Everyone be convinced with one direction and when it suddenly changes, you start seeing ppl come out saying the turning point was obvious. Like where was you yesterday, Joe? It’s all a fuckin coin toss.
IBM WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU

So this daily ETF newsletter I get from my broker says that ARKK, based on TA, has a 19% move to the downside possible.  Wonder what will drive that lol....oh wait, what is ARKK's largest holding? TSLA.  Likely TLSA will continue to go up and magic lines are full of shit 😏
LEVI is rolling down with the $19 downgrade. :/
Who do I report bullying to?
Last few times I've played earnings they were beat but the stock still gapped down 🙃
My only hope now is for apron to shit the bed today

Can anyone talk to me like I'm a fucking retard and explain why my 10 SPY 7/19 $301c's I bought for $17ea are a bad idea?
Fellow Disney bulls, we buying this dip?
Even as a Tesla permabull this is getting a little gross. Steady hands shitty brands
Omg so much left on the table selling my shop puts how far are you drilling today?
gold and gold miners just keep printing money. Now only waiting for rate cut so gold can print even more money.
I've come to the conclusion that I am the driving force behind the markets. We're not going up anymore until after the 31st, plan accordingly
The fuck is wrong with DIS today and yeaterday?
Bought shop calls yesterday, sold for 300% gain missed out on a 10 bagger so I shorted shop at today’s peak, made a few 200% gain puts, sold all at 325. Content but not really lol.
turns out I'm actually retarded
I think my App is broken. I keep refreshing and it never gets any better
What're you autist doing for EOD moves?

MSFT wyd tho
MICKY MOUSE PLEASEEEEE
Do we see a green day tomorow? Seems like this is a small pullback over the last few days of gains.
There is a lot of volume on NFLX 7/19 $400Cs.. how many of you auts bought those?! Almost 15,000 volume at about $3.00 each
Can someone tell me they lost more than me today? I don’t like feeling alone here. Tell me about your losses
I don’t trade much anymore but I’m thinking puts on BAC. Cause why not?
So do we think DIS moves on NFLX numbers? Somehow got 400 contracts DIS calls..
I have a feeling tomorrow will be another lesson in "don't buy puts in 2019". It's too obvious it wants to drop majorly.
My dd says Disney will be 160 eom but I'm new at this
JnJ theta eating bastard
Guys I think I got cucked by the Zucc
This relentless  bear market has me worried for peoples jobs and my country 🤢🤮

NFLX chart is dancing the Watusi.
hmmm NFLX beat but sales miss, sub miss by 50%??!.... doesn't look good for tomorrow...
I just bought Microsoft 137$ calls 7-19 like a dumbass laugh at me it’s gunna plummet more ain’t it
I bought 1 NFLX $300P for like $10 .. come on baby
I want to see heavy gains/loss porn tomorrow on Netflix. Give me some motivation
Locked in $500 today after pulling some technical analysis straight out of my ass
holy FUCK Netflix. Kinda glad I didn't even have enough money to buy calls on that one yikes.
F to QQQ bulls :(
NETFLIX HOLY SHIT
i cancelled netflix when they hiked up the monthly price. looks like i wasn't the only one lol.  so what's next? monthly price with ads? yea, fuck that.
Netflix and Kill
Lol turns out I was wayyy too conservative with my call credit spreads on Netflix
And also think twice before you buy the NFLX dipLook at what happened to FB last July after their shitty earnings
When NFLX beats and skyrockets everyone has gain porn.  When they fall like this no one has loss porn?
Reason NFLX is down is because 2.7m subscription adds vs 5.0m estimate.
*chuckles*I’m in danger
Microsoft...what did I ever do to you, man?? Fuck...Wiping Windows 10 for Linux after this buggery
Fucked by MSFT

Is Disney a pseudo monopoly?

Damn Bears eating.
Strongly considering switching from MSFT calls to puts. I've got 9/20 140c I picked up yesterday, but I'm not feeling too great about them...
I'll tell you, laughing through the pain with you all is all I have left and I want to thank you all for the goofy shit.
What the fuck happened
Oof did they say the N word in that nflx CC?
FED needs to cut rates so more people can afford to watch Netflix constantly, that’s what the economy needs
Just watching everyone reeee about NFLX while I wait for glorious eBay earnings call. Who would have thought the long term position with solid fundamentals and reasonable growth prospects would be a better pick than a company at 130x earnings with "legit analysts" projecting perpetual growth?
DIS after hours making me bigly sad by thr minute
Real question is do we get a dead cat bounce back to 325 so I can profit on my iron condors?

Everyone please reply with any insider info you have so that it becomes public knowledge and we can all make some legal tendies.     Trust me, I know someone that says he's a lawyer, is definitely not with the sec, and says this is totally legal
MSFT has something up it's sleeve. It's bull season. Follow Disney to the 145 land
LOL NOW MS COME OUT AND SAYS TSLA GETTING CHINA RIGHT 😂😂😂 fucking love these manipulators
All in on MSFT tomorrow. Never been this deep in a single bet before. 😬😬😬
The serial downvoter is back, my bet is on love2fuk/farts
Lmao mango is not letting up on the 4 commies. >They’re the reason there are directions on a shampoo bottle, & we should ignore them
Started with 30k in March-April 2017. Went upto around 36k and cashed out of 6kOct-Dec happened.. **went down to  80% all time. I am still down around 47% all time**. Working my way back slowly but surely. Lowest point was 6k currently around 14k.What helped1. Goal was to make $100 a day.. Burn a day trade if needed.2. Steady job income helped a lot..Added some money and took profits to still keep the chart pinned to 30k.3. Swing traded with 5k and just had 1k in options at any given time.4. As the account increased, poured that money into swing trading and kept only 1k as optionCurrently, 13k in swing trades with really tight stops where losses are kept to 30-50$ and winning trades are cashed out around 300-500$. All profits from swing trading are put back into swing trading at 90%. So basically if I make a 500$ profit, I put 450$ back in swing trading account and take $50 to the bank. Goal is to get back to 30k and swing trade that base. Once achieved, I have around 30k sitting on the side cash incase we hit meltdown to grab cheap stocks.1k options. some yolos here and there. One of them usually hits to keep option size 1k.
I've made insane profit the last week. Like $1,000 in a day profit.I'm now locked for 180 days, with MRK, AMD and TSLA calls rolling. I'ma start selling those off this week, pull the 💰 out and buy a HTC Vive and maybe an Apple Watch. I love gambling
Jfc Cramer that was DARK damn....

Joining theta gang, best decision of my life.Market doesn't move = your account moves (up, because you're making money)How do you play earnings? Just bet where the price won't go, which is way easier than betting where it will. You're vega negative so IV crush is your friend (aside from theta who is also your friend)Your plays have cute names like bull spread, butterfly and condor.If you accidentally get assigned you now have stonks and r/investing told me those always go up

For all of you crazy MSFT call holders, especially fds, think of what will likely happen (cloud, services booming lead to big earnings beat) and then think of what would have to happen for the fewest amount of retail investors to actually profit. Sure, it might be bullshit, but it will also stop you from buying dumb fd's that you'd better have day trades for to dump.In the case of MSFT, I think it'll pull back no matter how well their earnings are and begin it's slow and steady climb soon after.
Maybe somebody already posted this but yeah, when you're balls deep in FDs and have no day trades left....http://imgur.com/a/DXlMcfF

Close my fucking WMT positions. I had a single 116C that I bought Friday. Accidently hit buy yesterday instead of sell. Ok, whatever. I'll close it Tuesday. Tuesday rolls around, same shit happens and now I have 4 otm FDs that I bought at the top each time. ReeeeeeeDisclaimer: I also have a dozen WMT 114C FDs that I can't close without getting a PDT ban. so I am literally kicking myself in the balls the past two days losing profit instead of LOCKING IT IN! Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Futures look confused.
Thank god my three day trades from last week's $SPY rollercoaster ride are cleared. Time to print some tendies, bois.I'm selling my CALLS IN: $USO, $XLF, $VXX(Maybe), $EFA and $AMD. Then I'm going to sit and find a few stonks that I might trade on. Maybe even $SPY again.
Those Yung APRN puts that I bought when underlying was +70% hopefully produce some additional tendies
If any analysts are reading this: Please 'upgrade' $JNJ tomorrow. We all know those asbestos settlements and trials are bullshit and nothing will happen with them
Hoping that oil dd was right
I think I'm going to just start yoloing into SPY calls right at close and sell at open next day for Christ sake. $10 (I'm poor) says we spoke until 10 then fade until 2, then slowly back to open.

Love when I see people on this sub who live and die by support/resistance and chart patterns.Here is a random walk simulating a stock following Brownian motion I generated the first time:  [https://imgur.com/a/OgxU0MK](https://imgur.com/a/OgxU0MK) . Without knowing these prices follow a random walk people really be saying shit like "48 is the key support,if that breaks look for more downside." Or maybe "Look at that inverse head and shoulders we saw after bottoming out at 44, was a good set up for a run higher. "Confirmation biases is a bitch. Just my two cents.
I think the new rules are only going to apply to me and maybe a select others since it's dependent on users reporting and I have a couple people here who arent too fond of me. With that said, long WM Long LMT seems like a good dip entry Keep riding LOW up to near 120Get in OLLI and ride to 100

Looks like I got lucky playing SGEN. They missed earnings but the call was good about some clinical shit. I just skimmed the yahoo notes but will have a listen to the call later.Bought 8/2 $50 calls for $14.5Sold 7/19  $70 calls for $1.5Stock ended up at $68 after hours.
Why do people keep posting and deleting shit about this EIGI ticker
Hopefully watch my JBHT puts come back from the dead. I even thought I did some worthwhile DD before buying them. Obviously there is weakness (CSX, UNP) there I guess I just shorted the wrong fuckin stock. 💩

From 1-11 how fucked are my 7/17 spy 300 calls I bought today?
