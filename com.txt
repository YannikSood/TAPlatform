It's obvious through CRWD's ER success that cyber security is in huge demand by the market for the next 52 weeks at least. Here's two more cyber security stocks presenting earnings in August:\- Carbon Black (CBLK) - ER  8/1\- Zscaler (ZS) - ER 8/29

Selling all my MSFT calls at open and going back to trying to blow myself
How many here don't trade futures and just look all night long like retards
That MSFT call was so upbeat it has me scurred about muh rate cuts a little bit.
What happened to our future?
My MSFT 138 8/30 calls better be printing tomorrow
Today summed up: BULLS FUCK BEARS FOR 198th DAY IN A ROW
Bought some MSFT 140 calls for next week. Curious to see if the jump will outweigh the change in volatility tomorrow
Pump the conference call Papa Nadella
Sell my 299c 7/24 at open. Feel some redemption after buying my puts at ATH last week, wimping out, selling while it was holding 300 and watching SPY tank immediately after. Coulda made a pretty penny. V important to keep hands STRONG.
Sit and shake my head at my MSFT calls
With the recent BA announcement, BA puts literally free money for ER?EDIT: DDhttps://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cer1q6/daily_discussion_thread_july_18_2019/eu5q20m/

Im concerned about how "sticky" CRWD is with customers, according to their CEO
Rh with an UI update taking out the up and down word and replacing them with sideways arrows....Omg
Listening to this conference call everything is growth, increases and record numbers. Glad I ended up buying calls on Microsoft.
Imagine when big daddy Bezos reports?Bears will be extinct
I might be deaf but I'm pretty sure I just heard a caller drop the F-bomb on the COF earnings call.
OUTLOOK INCREASE!
Guidance seems good. Should pump more.
Great gains in gold today. All I can think of is that sweet capital gains tax the gov must been drooling over
(‚Ä¢_‚Ä¢)  ( ‚Ä¢_‚Ä¢)>‚åê‚ñ†-‚ñ†  (‚åê‚ñ†_‚ñ†) $140
Do the wheenie helicopter since I loaded up on spy calls on the dip. Thanks wsb for throwing risk management out the window!
Fukkkin damm, Spy covered some distance from dip today.  Don‚Äôt fight the Fed folks
At this rate MSFT call holders might actually make money üòÖü§ë
Fucks going on rn..
Never doubted the gayness of futures traders for once
Has the FED ever cut when the market was at an all time high?
Dreading tomorrow. I dunno what to do till the next MSFT ER. There is nothing else that compares, except maybe WM. Just buy calls far out and make money. This is unfair.
I‚Äôll be happy with a 5% from MSFT
Inb4 75bp rate cutBc why not üòé

So still holding some MSFT 139c, expiring next week. That was a sure thing but I‚Äôm down like 35%.  I also bought some CHWY stuff on a whim. $50 calls for October... I‚Äôm up a bit for those. I dunno what I‚Äôm doing
I‚Äôm closing all my positions, except maybe gld short puts, and sitting a few days out. Killed it last week. Killed it again this week barring my adderal fueled trades Monday. Need to take a few days off before I yolo something dumb again.
Yo this MSFT conference call has some tight music

Collect my tendies from put credit spreads on MSFT and cash out on 8/2 139C. Played this one perfectly

Gotta love that reverse rug pull!  Whose account is at an all time high as well right now? Feels good Gold Bros.

Crwd 12% and still going
\+12 MSFT 140C 7/26, any idea how much it would be worth tmr?Bought at 1.37 at market close, am I too positive hoping for a 20% profit?
Pray to the lords that gold doesn't lose its mind again.. Sorry everyone
why is BA up so much AH? and how are futures down so much when everything is up??
I might get a tendie or two from my spy calls tomorrow. What's my next play?
Holding LDOS, SPLK, MDT calls. Not sure what‚Äôs going to happen to my CHWY put yet.
i hope y‚Äôall got out of your gold calls üòÇüòÇ
Amazon 2k at open pls
If we touch 300 on SPY tomorrow‚Ä¶ You better start averaging into puts.
Be sad that my $10,500 in 0day ORCL puts have to die in order for my $11,500 in 0day ORCL calls to have a chance to liveee.RIP
25bps confirmed. 50 would have been overkill. If market goes down on a 25bp cut because they're asking for a 50bps, to me it's a perfect BTFD opportunity!
I didn‚Äôt think $MSFT would tickle 140 today, do I still immediately sell my 7/26 140c at open tomorrow?
Why futures turned red&#x200B;[https://www.forexlive.com/centralbank/!/new-york-fed-says-williams-speech-potential-policy-actions-at-the-july-fomc-meeting-20190718](https://www.forexlive.com/centralbank/!/new-york-fed-says-williams-speech-potential-policy-actions-at-the-july-fomc-meeting-20190718)

May Allah bless MSFT and Bill Gates
My only advise to anyone playing earnings, besides not fucking doing it, is to buy AT the money  at least a month out. Good luck, retards.

HA! CRWD got asked if the Symantic/Broadcom merger fall through had customers fleeing to them. CEO played it right ... "we just keep trying to build the best end point technology possible"&#x200B;Also, they made some points on pushing CRWD into more international markets, and going IPO gave them more attention. Hmmm...

MSFT is going to smash earnings guys.  I work in SaaS - they have assumed complete control with O365, Azure, and Teams.  Workplaces are lagging if they don't use the above.
If I short the stock, then cancel my Netflix subscription, is that considered insider trading ??
Take a moment to remember all of us who sold way OTM put spreads on NFLX cause easy money. Looks like I'll be taking a 14k L today.
Can we not let Netflix kick off earnings season next time?
Does anyone else feel like the second they look into how their options are doing for the day they always start to trend down?

Alright. I just deleted Robinhood, a good portion of my account is in Microsoft calls, calls in general. My hopes? That Microsoft crushes earnings with guidance that makes 07 Lohan seem like the next Michelle Obama, moons, and instills fresh hope within investors all across the market bringing it in tow.Now I‚Äôm going to have a nice worry free day. Watch some Designated Survivor, have a nice lunch and dinner, play some games. When I come back I will find myself several thousand dollars richer or poorer. Godspeed to you all.
Good thing about going down 50% on spy calls is that when it goes down again I lose less than I would‚Äôve if I was up on them. Crazy how percentages do that

Raymond James upgraded Apple and this is their thesis ‚ÄúOur call may well be early ‚Äì we expect this year‚Äôs iPhone cycle to be the weakest in years, and today may not be the right time to buy ahead of that weakness. But since the near-term market moves are being driven by macro conditions as much as fundamentals, we‚Äôve decided to upgrade now and let our clients decide the best time to execute on our idea.‚ÄùLolAlso upgraded because of "5g"

Don't fuck up today. Think before you stonk.
I got fkn wrecked the past two weeks, down 20k, my life savings was 30k, haven‚Äôt told anyone yet. My main problem was that I was winning every trade for way too long, I had no real idea of what my actual risk tolerance was. I started playing with way too much money and couldn‚Äôt handle the intra-week losses so I ended up with very weak hands, then I started trading on tilt and chasing stupid trades.I‚Äôm not gonna kill myself, I just needed to tell someone because I‚Äôm too embarrassed to tell my gf or parents.If you haven‚Äôt felt 40-50% losses yet, do not increase your net, because you don‚Äôt know how weak your hands are until you start watching your life savings evaporate.My last 6k is in a 7/26 spy 300c, currently down 400.
Cammon Raymond James: ‚ÄúWe feel that offering 5G at lower price points will drive a stronger product cycle, and early production plans tend to confirm that view‚Äù1) have no idea about price points (all confidential). knowing Apple, will not be cheap2) publicly released statement of Q4 20203) early production plans that they also have no idea aboutCan we fucking band together and make a WSB firm where we do zero DD and release these retarded statements with outrageous price points? Who the fuck even hires analysts or pay them anymore? Like Buzzfeed tier reporters
Oh yeah, $PM. Finally my carcinogenic racehorse is back in the game.

Morgan Stanley raises Chipotle $CMG to price target to $700 but doesn't upgrade its rating to "overweight" from "equal weight". If they are so bullish on Chipotle and raising the price target to $700 why maintain an equal weight rating, why not also give the stock an overweight rating like other stocks they are bullish on? I wonder if the analysts were asked to not rate the stock "overweight" to avoid the potential jokes and PR hassle from associating the fast food restaurant with the word "overweight" in any capacity or context.

SBUX is such a pesky stock staying up here.. But I'm pretty sure it's getting crushed on earnings if it does not pull back a bit into them. What's even the bull case? $BECKY I know.. But besides that? Stagnant revenue, over priced product no one wants in a recession, fucking $0.19 stock like 10 years back and now $90.50? Up 100% in a year, what? Has Starbuck's prolithicy increased 2 fold in the last year? Because their earnings sure as shit haven't.. Gimme a break, print tendies with my Aug 30th puts please.
gotta wheel strategy the fuck out of MSFT here. I'll take shares at 131.70 if I have to.

Everybody calling for a December repeat because SPY went down less than 1% today: you‚Äôre nuts. The fed put is in. Unless Powell suddenly pulls an interest rate cut off the table, things are not significantly going down based on earnings. Bad earnings would be even more reason to cut a full 1/2 point. Don‚Äôt fight the Fed.

Congrats on your yatchs for those who bought puts on Netflix.
so how much will my $455 NFLX calls be worth?
Goodbye everyone it‚Äôs been fun, I‚Äôm going to mcD and I‚Äôll be back in  30
Man, if MSFT misses or Azure doesn't meet growth expectations - it's gonna be brutal here.&#x200B;Don't go all in boys. I have plenty of friends at software/data companies that anecdotally say their business's are slowing, which means less spending on their cloud services.
I feel like I paid NFLX $500 to get my ass fisted
Netflix only has 1 season of impractical jokers and doesn't have the wolf of wall street. Of course they are going down.
Nice $10k worth of NFLX puts is now worth around $80,000 not me of course, I had calls
So let me see if I understand:The economy is simultaneously doing so well that it‚Äôs crazy to lower interest rates and yet so terribly that if we don‚Äôt lower interest rates, everything will fall apart.
Who sells their shares. Lol why do stocks go down. Just buy and hold forever. We'd all be rich
If there‚Äôs anything we‚Äôve learned from futures this week, it‚Äôs that they don‚Äôt mean shit
WSB finally bearish. Thank god, I thought my calls were dead in the water
When the market takes the stairs up, it takes the elevator down. This last 6 months, it took the elevator up. So I guess we take the window down.
Chickened out of buying NFLX puts... "*to win without danger is to win without glory. The same is true of Fortune. She seeks out the bravest men to match with her, some she passes by in disdain."*

WELPPpppppppppppppim ded. question is how ded am i. sold 2 NFLX 320p's.  (and 2 420c's). if it stays around 320 range then shiet ill be fine. but if it tanks further then oh god rope is ready. (+ im prob going to buy the dip)
Does the fetal position count as a move?
How the hell is NFLX going to convince people that they're going to get 9+M new subs next quarter when this quarter was so shit?

Opened up a spreadsheet today. Looked at P/L from all brokerage accounts. Officially down $8.5k in 8 months. Its been real brothers and sisters. Time for a break. See you guys Monday morning sharp.
Guys, not to be condescending, but if you don‚Äôt understand why Netflix, a 160b company, is moving the market after choking subscribers that bad...you need to re-evaluate your approach to trading. We are not going to have some miraculous rally to all time highs tomorrow - or anytime soon. God help us if Microsoft misses.
Watch my account hit zero most likely. Getting destroyed on DIS MSFT USO calls at the moment.
Mickey gang!!HEY MICKY U SO FINE OMG U BLOW MY MIND HEY MICKEY
In July 2018 Netflix $NFLX missed revenue estimates and lowered guidance and opened down even more than it's down now.  Gapped down 13%+ but then rallied more than 9% from open to close to finish down just 5% on the day.  Have faith.
Mr market, I don‚Äôt feel so good.
1.) Throw my money at the market. 2.) Watch the line go down.3.) Come back to WSB and feel better about myself
Any of y‚Äôall carrying NFLX puts? I‚Äôm surprised I don‚Äôt see more celebrating from put holders

Sitting on MSFT 138, 139 AND 140 C. Thinking I might grab more tomorrow,  depending how it's opens, ITM.  If it crushes,  I'm buying a yacht, if it misses, back to work for another year. Thoughts????
Remember buying NFLX puts around March and watching Hastings‚Äô smug ass raise subscription prices saying they‚Äôll never lose subscribers. Fuck i hope NFLX sinks to the ground just because I lost a petty 1k on that shit company.
If the market could pull a 2015-16 and double bottom off Dec‚Äôs lows that would be a fun play.

MSFT going to moon tomorrow. Still lots of large companies making the move to the cloud. Finally enough support for enterprise needs. AWS was first to market with a lot but Azure has some compelling offerings and this year is the year of the ‚Äúhybrid multi cloud‚Äù.  Enterprise is basically buying all of the clouds each for the parts they do well and tying everything together with APIs.  It an even better play long term but pretty sure we are going to see a huge increase from Azure.

Don't care if I lose money on this. 2. Credit spread on IRBT for apocalyptic IV crush. 3. XLNX. Don't know how yet. 4. Iron condor on MSFT... 142/143 and 134/133 .  Probably will tweak tomorrow, seeing how things play out. 5. TWLO credit spreads, probably both directions (i.e. iron condors)and much more!

Swear to baby Jesus, that if $UNH fucks me tomorrow...ima...ima...vote for fucking Bernie!
I did some research and re-evaluated my fundamental analysis of NFLX. In order to justify its 138:1 price to earnings ratio, every man woman and child on this planet would have to have watched stranger things season 4 at least twice.The proper valuation at the current financials is $38/share
All wsb thinks we're bearish now. We'll see

Wooo RobinHood removed my account restrictions for the after hours $0.68 margin call they got me for yesterday.I wonder how they stayed in business being out all that money for so long
So 1 month after my $6k in NFLX puts expire worthless, this happens. Of course.
If MSFT misses (which would be surprising), it's gonna scare a shitload of people out of the market
I'm telling you guys this pull back after options expiration is gonna be violent
Why didn't I buy Netflix puts?  Apparently because I'm dumb and I don't want to be rich like an asshole.

FOMO into Netflix puts
What I have learned from Netflix: Never give up on your puts. If they go down, buy more and further out expiry. If it goes down more, buy more puts. Eventually you will be victorious
Just saw a comment saying MSFT warnings are tomorrow, I only bought cause I thought they were next week like a true autist.Edit: I'm keeping it
Sheesh nflx still projects 7m adds globally for Q3. Not sure if we can believe when they miss projection so badly this time.Edit: reading thru their letter.They are adding in cheaper mobile screen plan to India in Q3 so that'll probably help the 7m I guess.

Has anyone taken a peak at Netfucks yet?
If we take a moment and think about market sentiment right now, this is not how it feels before a recession. The word fear comes to mind. SPY didn't break out to 310 immediately after crossing 300 so it must be a recession eh?Not saying it can't happen if MSFT, AAPL, GOOG AMZN start missing too. Just seems premature.
how much do you guys think a 7/26 $345 NFLX put would be worth tomorrow? It's deep ITM now, but how does IV factor in here
Stonks go up or down, but futures always go up. Cant explains that
Fucking hell.  I told myself for weeks to sit these ERs out, but the gains and ATHs went to my head.  I ended up FOMOing into SPY calls and blowing my account up 30%.I just want to get even from December.
I sold some of my msft calls before close. Will probably be down 40% on the remainder tomorrow. Thinking of getting yolo puts as a hedge but I‚Äôm real close to blowing up my account. I wish I would listen to myself sometimes.

If we correct 10% before fed meeting they cut 50% because they do not want to fight off european and Japanese liquidity trap with a financial crisis at home, and a protracted trade war.The Fed does not enough bps to fight all these fronts.  The neutral rate will continue to go lower without global synchronized fiscal and monetary stimulus.The fed cant fight this alone. When they lose the battle, the US enters it's own liquidity trap.

This is actually hilarious lolIf I'm holding puts, the market will be guaranteed to close at the day's high.If I'm holding calls, the market will be guaranteed to close at the day's low.I honestly couldn't lose money like this even if I tried
NFLX announcing its being acquired by BYND for $600 a share
We'll be telling our grand kiÃÅÃ§ÃµdÕ¢sÕëÕáÕò about how Spy was at 300 while theyre on the subway to work their 100 hour work week for Toyota, and watch girls eat noodles on YouTube.
Going to do some ketamine and smoke some weed and hopefully fall into an alternative universe where I bought Netflix puts and didn‚Äôt AVG down on MSFT calls
NFLX shouldn‚Äôt have ever been in FAANG, but people needed an N in the acronym.
I think we will lose 20% of people in this sub tomorrow from netflix

MSFT moonin', but SPY still actin' like a lil' bitch though--almost like it's comprised of 499 other companies or some shit
Red Wednesday means Green Thursday. Its science.
Lets all give a big F to the guy who bought 17000 contracts of $DIS 155 expiring this Friday. Even if that was something institutional you have to admire it.
i dont want to go back to rational stonk market . i want only up and trump pumps forever.
Every fucking day7am: "Maybe today won't be so bad"4pm: "I should have stayed in bed and started day drinking at dawn"
what kind of dip is this? french onion?
Netflix drops by 12%. WSB - Buy the dip bois we cant stay down for long
NFLX announcing gay porn streaming service during the call.  NFLX going to ATH
This week has almost wiped me out, but on the positive side...at least I'm not a $160bn company with a projected negative $3.5bn cash flow and shrinking subscriber growth.  I guess...
Soooooo the question on everyones mindIf Netflix drops out is it FAAG now
So glad all my work bathrooms are private. Get to go in for my 9:30 shit and trade in peace.
my OTM SHOP Calls are now ITM.... this is insane
Thought my PC was updating but turns out I‚Äôve just been watching MSFT graph this whole time
Whoever told us to buy shop puts 2 hours ago. Come get this blowjob
I just cant believe DIS is fucking me harder than JNJ
robinhood let us trade 0 day. The true FD.

Don‚Äôt worry y‚Äôall SPY earnings gonna save us.
Should've know BYND was the only worthwhile company adding value to our lives
Gonna watch all of wsb switch to puts tomorrow before MSFT blows earnings away.You know we good for that
NFLX leading off this round of tech ER was the exact opposite of what the market needed today.  MSFT will stop the bleeding.
Anyone got a remedy for raw asshole?
So much for spy gapping upüòµüò¨
Bloomberg with the P U M P article yesterday, who caught this gem?  [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-16/bullish-u-s-stock-buyers-are-positioning-for-a-giant-windfall](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-16/bullish-u-s-stock-buyers-are-positioning-for-a-giant-windfall) "That means SPY would need to advance at least 34% in 2019 for the max payout to be achieved, a level that hasn‚Äôt been seen in more than two decades. But it so happens that the last time it occurred, 1995, was a year in which the Federal Reserve [cut rates with stocks at all-time highs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-18/u-s-stocks-flirting-with-record-pose-no-hurdle-to-fed-rate-cuts), a phenomenon rates traders are expecting to occur again later this month."
today: depression, part 2: BAC edition
RIP to my SPY calls
idk why everyone thought BAC would pop $1 on earning like what
Mr. Market touched me inappropriately
why DIS keep fucking me
Bought some MSFT shares to help turn this dip around and help your calls bois
Whoa when did RH start with the flashing dot. It looks awesome
Is anyone else here straight up retarded?
[deleted]
Turns out good news is finally bad news
What an absolutely shitty weekF you, market
I had $21 LEVI Puts for 7/19 I bought before earnings when I told you guys nobody wears Levi‚Äôs anymore. I bought them at 0.2 since they were so far OTM and then sold them at .4. Today they are 2.18, I screwed myself out of a 10 bagger
I just saw PPT leave the White House and get into Marine One. Stand by everyone.
Holy shit, NFLX Call holders on suicide watch
RIP my NFLX iron condor
The one earnings play I guess right is the one I don‚Äôt have a position in. Go fucking figure
I think Im rich on NFLX puts...I didnt expect THIS
JNJ stonk up AH because NFLX put sellers and callholders stocking up baby oil
where were you when netflix brought down the global economy
NFLX is going to need one hell of a conference call
>Shares of Netflix fell 10% after the company reported global net adds of 2.7 million, well below guidance of 5 million.LMAO
WHERE MY NFLX PUT HOLDERS AT?? THE FUCKING TENDIES
[deleted]
So much for "Bigly Green" in the poll yesterday
NFLX is currently obviously THE key metric by which all tech companies valuation should be based.  Everything seems to have foundations of sand, I need to know why call credit spreads on pretty much everything for the next few weeks is a bad idea.Honestly MSFT dropping because NFLX fell?  Really?
NFLXüìâAAPL üìâAMZN üìâGOOG üìâMSFT üìâFB üìâADBE üìàü§î
Oh so bad news is bad news now?
NFLX's shareholder letter looks very amateurish[https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc\_financials/quarterly\_reports/2019/q2/Q2-19-Shareholder-Letter-FINAL.pdf](https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/quarterly_reports/2019/q2/Q2-19-Shareholder-Letter-FINAL.pdf)&#x200B;Seems like it was written in microsoft word with default fontsalmost like a middle school reportjust saying
When did NFLX become the indicator for the entire market?
Yo that last minute MSFT drop was not cool
Nflx is going to be my biggest loss yet tomorrow.
So FAANG is now FAAG right?
MSFT IS UP ALL I CARE ABOUT
BAC is so mediocre. What a turn off.
Can tsla to 270?
CRWD this is your time baby
Goddamit BAC why do you have to be so autistic
So is BAC going up or down today?

  Did Robinhood just add a dot to the line? This is what they thought needed fixing
It's impossible to tell where TSLA will go after its earnings release. The stock has gone up so much recently that it might have a "sell on the news" event or it might just head up higher if the guidance for the rest of the year is really good (especially if they say they will be profitable in Q3 and Q4). Looks like their China factory is also coming along nicely. One thing that might work against them is that the current quarter's delivery numbers will be very difficult to beat in Q3 and they still have to show some growth since they are a hypergrowth company.
Finally hit peasant gains of 400% on a TSLA call i bought at 177. Barely acceptable returns, but I think I will hold for the 10 bagger
~~blue~~ red apron
COME ON SPY!!U NEED MY üçÜ ENERGY!LETS GO üêÉüêÉüêÉ GANG.
Dropped 5k into SHOP FD puts too early in the morning. Watched as it went down -70%, now i'm somehow almost back to even. Gonna go have the worst jerk ever with these rock solid hands.
If i deposit 25k into RH right now do i immediately get unlimited daytrades? Or do i have to wait until next day
Why does being down 200 feel like a win? Oh wait, prolly cause being down 500 is normal.
I‚Äôm in on 139c $MSFT 7/26. I‚Äôm up $9. Most I‚Äôve been up since I lost 4K, lol.

Wow Netflix beats ....beats itself
It‚Äôs not just Netflix, everything is taking a dump after close.  Although Netflix is outperforming all the other drops.
NFLX 325 puts were 1.11$ each. Worth atleast 5$ tomorrow
I bought QQQ and NFLX puts at close yesterday and they called me a madman
Market red but my portfolio green. Something is definitely wrong.
MSFT is up 36% this year...and autists are still buying OTM calls. Sigh.
netflix is really about to be done for lol. barely beating their eps, burning cash, losing subs like crazy, i like their shows but they‚Äôre losing reruns of old hits. it‚Äôs done for especially with new competition coming out that have bigger hits than netflix ever had
What‚Äôs my NFLX $300P 7/19 going to be worth tomorrow?
I think the Nasdaq will rebound heavily tomorrow
I just checked my history on Shopify and I sold my 7/19 $250 calls for $250/each back in February.... Those are worth $8500 each today lol
RIP to the guy who posted and then deleted his thread about being up 1000% on his APRN 11c that he was going to hold. They're now worth less than he bought them for.

imagine having like 6 shares of AAPL and 4 shares of SPY and $200 in cash how much fun you'd have on a day like today manipulating the market so easily with the books so thin
I have a gut feeling nflx gonna go up
Lol I love how 2019 trained me to take profits on puts after a .15% drop thinking that's the best I'd get. Then of course buying calls because SPY almost always rips up from even the slightest of red daysFml
Pump pump pretty pleeze with cherry on top
Puts on Netflix man. Everybody favorite shit is leaving and the rent is too damn high. Also they keep contemplating ads. It's future disaster
Tbh I hope NFLX gets dogged. Stock triggers me with it's irrational movements
Who remembers the bull market?
JNJ this da bottom?
Holy fuck MSFT.
MSFT really just ruined my day lol
I couldn‚Äôt help myself. Put a few hundred on a NFLX put.
Finally broke even with TSLA. Now setting a stop loss at $250 and waiting for the ER tendie train. Then hopefully unloading 50% of my bags and let the rest run to $300.
that last 10 minutes was fucking retarded
NFLX drop looks like it made everything drop AH

So basically I won 3K in 2 weeks and lost it all in 1 day. Thanks AMZN and thanks NFLX for fucking with my AMZN calls. I feel like shit for not playing NfLX as I was pretty sure they would tank given that their main competitors released their best series during that period (GoT, Chernobyl, Handmaids tale).

Were a lot of people honestly bullish on netflix?E: i just mean as a user.  I feel like they have declined over time.  I took no positions on netflix either way as I had no good feelings on how it would pan out, but as a customer i've been waiting for a better option over the last 6 - 7 months i feel like.  After they landed those stand up specials, i've lost the lustE2: I loved the stand up specials, but "what have you done for me lately" is how this market acts.
anyone lose their shirt on NFLX calls?
LMAO, watch WSB turn into bears and MSFT still blows earnings out the water

I feel like I need to stop obsessing over what‚Äôs gonna happen tomorrow until tomorrow comes. No one knows what‚Äôs going to happen until it does. Case in point: Everyone be convinced with one direction and when it suddenly changes, you start seeing ppl come out saying the turning point was obvious. Like where was you yesterday, Joe?

There is a lot of volume on NFLX 7/19 $400Cs.. how many of you auts bought those?! Almost 15,000 volume at about $3.00 each
Can someone tell me they lost more than me today? I don‚Äôt like feeling alone here. Tell me about your losses
I don‚Äôt trade much anymore but I‚Äôm thinking puts on BAC. Cause why not?
So do we think DIS moves on NFLX numbers? Somehow got 400 contracts DIS calls..
I have a feeling tomorrow will be another lesson in "don't buy puts in 2019". It's too obvious it wants to drop majorly.

Locked in $500 today after pulling some technical analysis straight out of my ass
holy FUCK Netflix. Kinda glad I didn't even have enough money to buy calls on that one yikes.
F to QQQ bulls :(
NETFLIX HOLY SHIT
i cancelled netflix when they hiked up the monthly price. looks like i wasn't the only one lol.  so what's next? monthly price with ads? yea, fuck that.
Netflix and Kill
Lol turns out I was wayyy too conservative with my call credit spreads on Netflix
And also think twice before you buy the NFLX dipLook at what happened to FB last July after their shitty earnings
When NFLX beats and skyrockets everyone has gain porn.  When they fall like this no one has loss porn?
Reason NFLX is down is because 2.7m subscription adds vs 5.0m estimate.

I'll tell you, laughing through the pain with you all is all I have left and I want to thank you all for the goofy shit.
What the fuck happened
Oof did they say the N word in that nflx CC?
FED needs to cut rates so more people can afford to watch Netflix constantly, that‚Äôs what the economy needs
Just watching everyone reeee about NFLX while I wait for glorious eBay earnings call. Who would have thought the long term position with solid fundamentals and reasonable growth prospects would be a better pick than a company at 130x earnings with "legit analysts" projecting perpetual growth?

Started with 30k in March-April 2017. Went upto around 36k and cashed out of 6kOct-Dec happened.. **went down to  80% all time. I am still down around 47% all time**. Working my way back slowly but surely. Lowest point was 6k currently around 14k.What helped1. Goal was to make $100 a day.. Burn a day trade if needed.2. Steady job income helped a lot..Added some money and took profits to still keep the chart pinned to 30k.3. Swing traded with 5k and just had 1k in options at any given time.4. As the account increased, poured that money into swing trading and kept only 1k as optionCurrently, 13k in swing trades with really tight stops where losses are kept to 30-50$ and winning trades are cashed out around 300-500$. All profits from swing trading are put back into swing trading at 90%. So basically if I make a 500$ profit, I put 450$ back in swing trading account and take $50 to the bank. Goal is to get back to 30k and swing trade that base. Once achieved, I have around 30k sitting on the side cash incase we hit meltdown to grab cheap stocks.1k options. some yolos here and there. One of them usually hits to keep option size 1k.
I've made insane profit the last week. Like $1,000 in a day profit.I'm now locked for 180 days, with MRK, AMD and TSLA calls rolling. I'ma start selling those off this week, pull the üí∞ out and buy a HTC Vive and maybe an Apple Watch. I love gambling

For all of you crazy MSFT call holders, especially fds, think of what will likely happen (cloud, services booming lead to big earnings beat) and then think of what would have to happen for the fewest amount of retail investors to actually profit. Sure, it might be bullshit, but it will also stop you from buying dumb fd's that you'd better have day trades for to dump.In the case of MSFT, I think it'll pull back no matter how well their earnings are and begin it's slow and steady climb soon after.
Maybe somebody already posted this but yeah, when you're balls deep in FDs and have no day trades left....http://imgur.com/a/DXlMcfF

Love when I see people on this sub who live and die by support/resistance and chart patterns.Here is a random walk simulating a stock following Brownian motion I generated the first time:  [https://imgur.com/a/OgxU0MK](https://imgur.com/a/OgxU0MK) . Without knowing these prices follow a random walk people really be saying shit like "48 is the key support,if that breaks look for more downside." Or maybe "Look at that inverse head and shoulders we saw after bottoming out at 44, was a good set up for a run higher. "Confirmation biases is a bitch. Just my two cents.
I think the new rules are only going to apply to me and maybe a select others since it's dependent on users reporting and I have a couple people here who arent too fond of me. With that said, long WM Long LMT seems like a good dip entry Keep riding LOW up to near 120Get in OLLI and ride to 100

Anybody got any DD on KHC? In April, Kraft said its CEO was stepping down, effective July 1, to be replaced by Miguel Patricio, who faces plenty of challenges. IV popped higher after they announced Earnings to be released before the bell tomorrow.
Looks like I got lucky playing SGEN. They missed earnings but the call was good about some clinical shit. I just skimmed the yahoo notes but will have a listen to the call later.Bought 8/2 $50 calls for $14.5Sold 7/19  $70 calls for $1.5Stock ended up at $68 after hours.
Why do people keep posting and deleting shit about this EIGI ticker
Hopefully watch my JBHT puts come back from the dead. I even thought I did some worthwhile DD before buying them. Obviously there is weakness (CSX, UNP) there I guess I just shorted the wrong fuckin stock. üí©
anyone got ideas on why 25 million shares of acb were traded AH with no price movement? by far the most active stock AH

From 1-11 how fucked are my 7/17 spy 300 calls I bought today?
Do Asian markets usually have a down day when we have one? Does that mean futures will sell off more overnight or do they recover in anticipation of a bounce into tomorrow?
I should have pulled the trigger on SGEN. Fuck me sideways.
I am holding SPY $300 8/16 calls that I bought near low today along with SPY $270 8/16 puts that I bought about a month ago and have lost like ~90% on.
